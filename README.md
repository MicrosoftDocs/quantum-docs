# Azure Quantum documentation

Welcome to Azure Quantum! This is the repository for the Azure Quantum documentation.

This repository contains open-source documentation articles.  The main folder is **[articles/](./articles)** and contains the Markdown articles and YAML files that constitute the source of the [Azure Quantum documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/).

> :pencil: If your changes are only editorial, without association to the API, this is the right place to do it. You can directly edit 
> the `*.md` files here. You can also submit minor changes directly through the documentation page. For more information, see [Quick edits to documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/contribute/#quick-edits-to-documentation).
