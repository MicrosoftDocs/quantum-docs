# Azure Quantum documentation

Welcome to Azure Quantum! This is the repository for the Azure Quantum documentation.

This repository contains open-source documentation articles.  The main folder is **[articles/](./articles)** and contains the Markdown articles and YAML files that constitute the source of the [Azure Quantum documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/).

> the `*.md` files here. You can also submit minor changes directly through the documentation page. For more information, see [Minor changes to documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/contribute/content/how-to-write-overview#minor-changes-to-documentation)).
