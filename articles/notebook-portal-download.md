# Download your hosted Jupyter notebooks from your Quantum workspace

On October 15, 2025, the Azure Quantum service will discontinue support for integrated Jupyter notebooks hosted in Quantum workspaces. If you don't download your notebooks from your workspace before this date, then you'll lose access to your notebooks in the Azure portal.

To download your Jupyter notebooks to your device, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal.
1. Go to **Quantum Workspaces** and choose your desired workspace.
1. In the **Operations** dropdown on the workspace blade, choose **Notebooks**.
1. On the Jupyter Notebooks blade, open the **My notebooks** dropdown to view all your notebooks.
1. For each notebook that you want to download, choose the **ellipsis button** (...), and then choose **Download Notebook** to download the notebook to your device.
