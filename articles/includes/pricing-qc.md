## IonQ 

[IonQ](https://ionq.com/) charges based on the number of gates in your program, the complexity of the gates you use, and the number of shots. These units are called *gate-shots*.

Every quantum program consists of $N$ quantum logical gates of one or more qubits, and is executed for a certain number of shots. The number of gate-shots is calculated by the following formula:

$$
QGS = N · C
$$

where:

- $N$ is the number of one- or two-qubit gates submitted
- $C$ is the number of execution shots requested


Multi-controlled two-qubit gates are billed as $6 * (N - 2)$ two-qubit gates, where $N$ is the number of qubits involved in the gate. For example, a NOT gate with three controls would be billed as $(6 * (4 - 2))$ or 12 two-qubit gates. One-qubit gates are billed as 0.225 of a two-qubit gate (rounded down). To learn more about IonQ, visit [IonQ provider page](xref:microsoft.quantum.providers.ionq).


All new Azure Quantum customers benefit of a one-time $500 (USD) free Azure Quantum credits toward IonQ provider to use in IonQ QPUs Harmony and Aria, and quantum simulator. Besides the Azure Quantum Credits plan, IonQ offers a **pay-as-you-go** plan with access to the quantum simulator and the IonQ Harmony 11-qubit quantum computer, and a **monthly subscription** plan which expands the access to the IonQ Aria 23-qubit quantum computer. 

### [Azure Quantum Credits](#tab/tabid-AQcredits)

Azure Quantum Credits consumption is based on a resource-usage model and cost of use is deducted from your credits. To learn more about credits, see [Azure Quantum Credits](xref:microsoft.quantum.credits).

|---|---|  
|Includes access to | <ul><li>IonQ Harmony QPU</li><li>IonQ Aria QPU</li><li>IonQ Simulator (free)</li></ul>|
| IonQ Harmony |<ul><li>1-Qubit Gate Shot: $0.00003 (USD) deducted from your credits</li><li>2-Qubit Gate Shot: $0.0003 (USD) deducted from your credits</li></ul>|

Minimum of $1 (USD) per program execution, deducted from your credits. 

> [!NOTE]
> Once you have consumed all the credits you need to switch to a different plan to continue using IonQ. Azure Quantum won’t start charging you once you reach your credit limit. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are no costs or charges to using your free credits. However, there may be some small storage costs, as the input and output of your credits jobs are stored in a storage account that you pay for. Job data is typically <1MB per job. 
> For more details, see [Azure Blob Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/).

## Quantinuum

[Quantinuum](https://www.quantinuum.com/) uses a credit system that charges each job depending on the number of operations in the job, and the number of shots you run. The usage units are *H-System Quantum Credits (HQCs)* for jobs submitted to System Model H1 quantum computers, Powered by Quantinuum, and emulator HQCs (eHQCs) for jobs submitted to System Model H1 emulators.

> [!NOTE]
> Do not confuse the Quantinuum HQCs with the Azure Quantum credits. Quantinuum HQCs are a usage unit defined by the provider to track the usage and quotas of their targets.

HQCs and eHQCs are used to calculate the cost of running a job, and they are calculated based on the following formula:

$$
HQC = 5 + C(N_{1q} + 10 N_{2q} + 5 N_m)/5000
$$

where:

- $N_{1q}$ is the number of single-qubit operations in a circuit.
- $N_{2q}$ is the number of native two-qubit operations in a circuit. Native gate is equivalent to CNOT up to several single-qubit gates.
- $N_{m}$ is the number of state preparation and measurement (SPAM) operations in a circuit including initial implicit state preparation and any intermediate and final measurements and state resets.
- $C$ is the shot count.

To learn more about Quantinuum, visit the [Quantinuum provider page](xref:microsoft.quantum.providers.quantinuum).

All new Azure customers benefit from $500 (USD) in free credits towards the Quantinuum provider. Besides Azure Quantum credits, Quantinuum provides two plans: **Standard Subscription** and **Premium Subscription**.
