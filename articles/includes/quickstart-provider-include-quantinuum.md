## Load the required imports

First, run the following cell to load the required imports:

```python
from azure.quantum import Workspace
```

## Connect to the Azure Quantum service

To connect to the Azure Quantum service, your program will need the resource ID and the
location of your Azure Quantum workspace. Log in to your Azure account,
<https://portal.azure.com>, navigate to your Azure Quantum workspace, and
copy the values from the header.

![How to retrieve the resource ID and location from an Azure Quantum workspace](../media/azure-quantum-resource-id.png)

Paste the values into the following `Workspace` constructor to
create a `workspace` object that connects to your Azure Quantum workspace.

```python
workspace = Workspace(
    resource_id="",
    location=""
)
```

## Submit a quantum circuit to the Quantinuum API validator

1. Create a quantum circuit in the [OpenQASM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenQASM) representation. For example, the following example creates a Teleportation circuit:

    ```py
    circuit = """OPENQASM 2.0;
    include "qelib1.inc";
    qreg q[3];
    creg c0[3];
    h q[0];
    cx q[0], q[1];
    cx q[1], q[2];
    measure q[0] -> c0[0];
    measure q[1] -> c0[1];
    measure q[2] -> c0[2];
    """
    ```

    Optionally, you can load the circuit from a file:

    ```py
    with open("my_teleport.qasm", "r") as f:
        circuit = f.read()
    ```

1. Submit the circuit to the Quantinuum target. The following example uses the Quantinuum API validator, which returns a `Job` object. For more information, see [Azure Quantum Job](xref:microsoft.quantum.optimization.job-referenc).

    ```python
    target = workspace.get_targets(name="quantinuum.sim.h1-1sc")
    job = target.submit(circuit, num_shots=500)
    ```

1. Wait until the job is complete and then fetch the results.

    ```python
    results = job.get_results()
    print(results)
    ```

    ```output
    ........
    {'c0': ['000',
    '000',
    '000',
    '000',
    '000',
    '000',
    '000',
    ...
    ]}
    ```

1. You can then visualize the results using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html).

    ```python
    import pylab as pl
    pl.hist(results["c0"])
    pl.ylabel("Counts")
    pl.xlabel("Bitstring")
    ```

![Quantinuum job output](../media/quantinuum-results.png)

Looking at the histogram, you may notice that the random number generator returned 0 every time, which is not very random. This is because that, while the API Validator ensures that your code will run successfully on Quantinuum hardware, it also returns 0 for every quantum measurement. For a true random number generator, you need to run your circuit on quantum hardware.

## Estimate job cost

Before running a job on the QPU, you can estimate how much it will cost to run. To estimate the cost of running a job on the QPU, you can use the `estimate_cost` method:

```python
target = workspace.get_targets(name="quantinuum.qpu.h1-1")
cost = target.estimate_cost(circuit, num_shots=500)

print(f"Estimated cost: {cost.estimated_total}")
```

This prints the estimated cost in H-System Quantum Credits (HQCs).

For the most current pricing details, see [Azure Quantum pricing](xref:microsoft.quantum.providers-pricing#quantinuum), or find your workspace and view pricing options in the "Provider" tab of your workspace via: [aka.ms/aq/myworkspaces](https://aka.ms/aq/myworkspaces).
