## Prerequisites

To run the code sample in the [Copilot for Azure Quantum](https://quantum.microsoft.com/experience/quantum-coding), you need:

- A Microsoft (MSA) email account.

For more information about the Copilot, see [Explore Azure Quantum](xref:microsoft.quantum.get-started.azure-quantum).

## Initialize a qubit to a known state

The first step is to define a Q# operation that will initialize a qubit to a known state. This can be called to set a qubit to a classical state, meaning that, when measured, it either returns `Zero` 100% of the time or returns `One` 100% of the time. Measuring a qubit returns a Q# type `Result`, which can only have a value of `Zero` or `One`.

Open the [Copilot for Azure Quantum](https://quantum.microsoft.com/experience/quantum-coding) and copy the following code into the code editor window. Don't click **Run** yet; you'll run the code later in the tutorial.

```qsharp
   namespace Bell {
       open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;
       open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

       operation SetQubitState(desired : Result, target : Qubit) : Unit {
           if desired != M(target) {
               X(target);
           }
       }
   }
```

The code example introduces two standard operations, `M` and `X`, which transform the state of a qubit.

The `SetQubitState` operation:

1. Takes two parameters: a type [`Result`](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp.typesystem-overview#available-types), named `desired`, that represents the desired state for the qubit to be in (`Zero` or `One`), and a type [`Qubit`](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp.typesystem-overview#available-types). 
1. Performs a measurement operation, `M`, which measures the state of the qubit (`Zero` or `One`) and compares the result to the value specified in `desired`.
1. If the measurement does not match the compared value, it runs an `X` operation, which flips the state of the qubit to where the probabilities of a measurement returning `Zero` and `One` are reversed. This way, `SetQubitState` always puts the target qubit in the desired state. 

## Write a test operation to test the Bell state

Next, to demonstrate the effect of the `SetQubitState` operation, create another operation named `TestBellState`. This operation will allocate two qubits, call `SetQubitState` to set the first qubit to a known state, and then measure the qubits to see the results.

Copy the following code into the code editor window, below the `SetQubitState` operation. 

```qsharp
operation TestBellState() : (Int, Int, Int, Int) {
    mutable numOnesQ1 = 0;
    mutable numOnesQ2 = 0;
    let count = 1000;
    let initial = One;

    // allocate the qubits
    use (q1, q2) = (Qubit(), Qubit());   
    for test in 1..count {
        SetQubitState(initial, q1);
        SetQubitState(Zero, q2);
        
        // measure each qubit
        let resultQ1 = M(q1);            
        let resultQ2 = M(q2);           

        // Count the number of 'Ones' returned:
        if resultQ1 == One {
            set numOnesQ1 += 1;
        }
        if resultQ2 == One {
            set numOnesQ2 += 1;
        }
    }

    // reset the qubits
    SetQubitState(Zero, q1);             
    SetQubitState(Zero, q2);
    

    // Display the times that |0> is returned, and times that |1> is returned
    Message($"Q1 - Zeros: {count - numOnesQ1}");
    Message($"Q1 - Ones: {numOnesQ1}");
    Message($"Q2 - Zeros: {count - numOnesQ2}");
    Message($"Q2 - Ones: {numOnesQ2}");
    return (count - numOnesQ1, numOnesQ1, count - numOnesQ2, numOnesQ2 );

}
```

In the code, the `count` and `initial` variables are set to `1000` and `One` respectively. This initializes the first qubit to `One` and measures each qubit 1000 times.

The `TestBellState`operation:

1. Sets variables for the counter and the initial qubit state.
1. Calls the `use` statement to initialize two qubits.
1. Loops for `count` iterations. For each loop, it
    1. Calls `SetQubitState` to set a specified `initial` value on the first qubit.
    1. Calls `SetQubitState` again to set the second qubit to a `Zero` state.
    1. Uses the `M` operation to measure each qubit.
    1. Stores the number of measurements for each qubit that return `One`.
1. After the loop completes, it calls `SetQubitState` again to reset the qubits to a known state (`Zero`) to allow others to
allocate the qubits in a known state. This is required by the `use` statement.
1. Finally, it uses the `Message` function to print results to the Copilot output windows before returning the results.

## Run the code in the Copilot for Azure Quantum

Before moving on to the procedures for superposition and entanglement, you can test the code up to this point to see the initialization and measurement of the qubits.

In order to run the code as a standalone program, the Q# compiler in the Copilot needs to know *where* to start the program. This is done in the Q# file by adding an `@EntryPoint()` directly preceding the operation that you want to run first. For example, in this case is the `TestBellState` operation.

> [!NOTE]
> `@EntryPoint()` is only required for standalone Q# programs. When running a Q# program in Jupyter Notebooks, or calling a Q# program from a Python host file, it isn't required and will throw an error if included.

Add the `@EntryPoint()` immediately before `TestBellState` operation and your Q# program up to this point should now look like this:

```qsharp
namespace Bell {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

    operation SetQubitState(desired : Result, target : Qubit) : Unit {
        if desired != M(target) {
            X(target);
        }
    }

    @EntryPoint()
    operation TestBellState() : (Int, Int, Int, Int) {
        mutable numOnesQ1 = 0;
        mutable numOnesQ2 = 0;
        let count = 1000;
        let initial = One;

        // allocate the qubits
        use (q1, q2) = (Qubit(), Qubit());   
        for test in 1..count {
            SetQubitState(initial, q1);
            SetQubitState(Zero, q2);
            
            // measure each qubit
            let resultQ1 = M(q1);            
            let resultQ2 = M(q2);           
    
            // Count the number of 'Ones' returned:
            if resultQ1 == One {
                set numOnesQ1 += 1;
            }
            if resultQ2 == One {
                set numOnesQ2 += 1;
            }
        }
    
        // reset the qubits
        SetQubitState(Zero, q1);             
        SetQubitState(Zero, q2);
        
    
        // Display the times that |0> is returned, and times that |1> is returned
        Message($"Q1 - Zeros: {count - numOnesQ1}");
        Message($"Q1 - Ones: {numOnesQ1}");
        Message($"Q2 - Zeros: {count - numOnesQ2}");
        Message($"Q2 - Ones: {numOnesQ2}");
        return (count - numOnesQ1, numOnesQ1, count - numOnesQ2, numOnesQ2 );

    }
}

```

Copy and paste the complete code sample into the [Copilot for Azure Quantum](https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/experience/quantum-coding) code window, set the slide for the number of shots to "1", and click **Run**. The results are displayed in the histogram and in the **Results** fields.

```output
Q1 - Zeros: 0
Q1 - Ones: 1000
Q2 - Zeros: 1000
Q2 - Ones: 0
```

Because the qubits haven't been manipulated yet, they have retained their initial values: the first qubit returns `One` every time, and the second qubit returns `Zero`.

If you change the value of `initial` to `Zero` and run the program again, you should observe that the first qubit also returns `Zero` every time.

```output
Q1 - Zeros: 1000
Q1 - Ones: 0
Q2 - Zeros: 1000
Q2 - Ones: 0
```

## Put a qubit in superposition

Currently, the qubits in the program are all in a **classical state**, that is, they are either 1 or 0. You know this because the program initializes the qubits to a known state, and you haven't added any processes to manipulate them.  Before entangling the qubits, you will put the first qubit into a **superposition state**, where a measurement of the qubit will return `Zero` ~50% of the time and `One` ~50% of the time. Conceptually, the qubit can be thought of as having an equal probability of measuring either `Zero` or `One`.

To put a qubit in superposition, Q# provides the `H`, or *Hadamard*, operation. Recall the `X` operation from the [Initialize a qubit to a known state](#initialize-a-qubit-to-a-known-state) procedure earlier, which flipped a qubit from 0 to 1 (or vice versa); the `H` operation flips the qubit *halfway* into a state of equal probabilities of `Zero` or `One`. When measured, a qubit in superposition should return roughly an equal number of `Zero` and `One` results.

Modify the code in the `TestBellState` operation by resetting the initial value to `One` and inserting a line for the `H` operation:

```qsharp
for test in 1..count {
    use (q1, q2) = (Qubit(), Qubit());   
    for test in 1..count {
        SetQubitState(initial, q1);
        SetQubitState(Zero, q2);
        
        H(q1);                // Add the H operation after initialization and before measurement

        // measure each qubit
        let resultQ1 = M(q1);            
        let resultQ2 = M(q2); 
        ...
```

Now when you run the program, you can see the results of the first qubit in superposition. 

```output
Q1 - Zeros: 523            // results will vary
Q1 - Ones: 477
Q2 - Zeros: 1000
Q2 - Ones: 0
```

Every time you run the program, the results for the first qubit will vary slightly, but will be close to 50% `One` and 50% `Zero`, while the results for the second qubit will remain `Zero` all the time.

```output
Q1 - Zeros: 510           
Q1 - Ones: 490
Q2 - Zeros: 1000
Q2 - Ones: 0
```

Initializing the first qubit to `Zero` returns similar results.

```output
Q1 - Zeros: 504           
Q1 - Ones: 496
Q2 - Zeros: 1000
Q2 - Ones: 0
```

> [!NOTE]
> By moving the slider in the Copilot for Azure Quantum and increasing the number of shots, you can see how the superposition results vary slightly over the distribution of the shots.

## Entangle two qubits

As mentioned earlier, entangled qubits are connected such that they cannot be described independently from each other. That is, whatever operation happens to one qubit, also happens to the entangled qubit. This allows you to know the resulting state of one qubit without measuring it, just by measuring the state of the other qubit. (This example uses two qubits; however, it is also possible to entangle three or more qubits).

To enable entanglement, Q# provides the `CNOT` operation, which stands for *Controlled-NOT*.  The result of running this operation on two qubits is to flip the second qubit if the first qubit is `One`.

Add the `CNOT` operation to your program immediately after the `H` operation. Your full program should look like this:

```qsharp
namespace Bell {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

       operation SetQubitState(desired : Result, target : Qubit) : Unit {
           if desired != M(target) {
               X(target);
           }
       }

    @EntryPoint()
    operation TestBellState() : (Int, Int, Int, Int) {
        mutable numOnesQ1 = 0;
        mutable numOnesQ2 = 0;
        let count = 1000;
        let initial = Zero;

        // allocate the qubits
        use (q1, q2) = (Qubit(), Qubit());   
        for test in 1..count {
            SetQubitState(initial, q1);
            SetQubitState(Zero, q2);
        
            H(q1);            
            CNOT(q1, q2);      // Add the CNOT operation after the H operation

            // measure each qubit
            let resultQ1 = M(q1);            
            let resultQ2 = M(q2);           
    
            // Count the number of 'Ones' returned:
            if resultQ1 == One {
                set numOnesQ1 += 1;
            }
            if resultQ2 == One {
                set numOnesQ2 += 1;
            }
        }
    
        // reset the qubits
        SetQubitState(Zero, q1);             
        SetQubitState(Zero, q2);
        
    
        // Display the times that |0> is returned, and times that |1> is returned
        Message($"Q1 - Zeros: {count - numOnesQ1}");
        Message($"Q1 - Ones: {numOnesQ1}");
        Message($"Q2 - Zeros: {count - numOnesQ2}");
        Message($"Q2 - Ones: {numOnesQ2}");
        return (count - numOnesQ1, numOnesQ1, count - numOnesQ2, numOnesQ2 );

    }
}
```

Now when you run the program you should see something like:

```output
Q1 - Zeros: 502           // results will vary
Q1 - Ones: 498
Q2 - Zeros: 502
Q2 - Ones: 498
```

Notice that the statistics for the first qubit haven't changed (there is still a ~50/50 chance of a `Zero` or a `One` after measurement), but the measurement results for the second qubit are **always** the same as the measurement of the first qubit, no matter how many times you run the program. The `CNOT` operation has entangled the two qubits, so that whatever happens to one of them, happens to the other.
