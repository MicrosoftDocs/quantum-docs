## Submitting Q# jobs to Azure Quantum

Learn how to use VS Code to run, debug, and submit a Q# program to Azure Quantum.

## Prerequisites

For installation details, see [Installing the QDK on VS Code](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview#installing-the-qdk-on-vs-code).

- An Azure Quantum workspace in your Azure subscription. To create a workspace,
  see [Create an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace).
- The latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or open [VS Code on the Web](https://vscode.dev/).
- The latest version of the [Azure Quantum Development Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.qsharp-lang-vscode).

## Load a Q# sample program

1. In VS Code, select **File > New Text File** and save the file as **RandomNum.qs**.
1. Open **RandomNum.qs** and type `sample`, then select **Random Bit sample** from the list of options and save the file.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also open your own Q# file. If you run an older Q# program and run into errors, see [Testing and debugging](xref:microsoft.quantum.user-guide-qdk.overview.testingdebugging).

## Run a Q# program

1. To test run your program locally on the built-in simulator, click on **Run** from the list of commands below `@EntryPoint()`, or press **Ctrl+F5**. Your output will appear in the debug console.
1. To debug your program before submitting it to Azure Quantum, click on **Debug** from the list of commands below `@EntryPoint()`, or press **F5**. Use the debugging controls at the top to step over, into, and out of the code. For more information about debugging Q# programs, see [Testing and debugging](xref:microsoft.quantum.user-guide-qdk.overview.testingdebugging).

## Visualize the frequency histogram

The frequency histogram represents the distribution of results obtained from running a quantum program multiple times, or "shots". Each bar in the histogram corresponds to a possible outcome, and its height represents the number of times that outcome is observed. The frequency histogram helps visualize the probability distribution of these outcomes.

1. Select **View -> Command Palette** and type “histogram” which should bring up the **Q#: Run file and show histogram** option. You can also click on **Histogram** from the list of commands below `@EntryPoint()`. Select this option to open the Q# histogram window.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/codelens-histogram.png" alt-text="Screenshot the Q# file in Visual Studio Code showing where to find the code lens with histogram command.":::

1. Enter a number of **shots** to execute the program, for example, 100 shots, and press **Enter**. The histogram will display in the Q# histogram window.
1. Click the top-left **settings icon** to display options.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/histogram-vscode-random-bit-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot the Q# histogram window in Visual Studio Code showing how to display settings.":::

1. Click on a bar to display the **percentage** of that outcome. In this case there are two possible outcomes, 0 and 1, and the percentage of each outcome is close to 50%.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/histogram-vscode-random-bit.png" alt-text="Screenshot the Q# histogram window in Visual Studio Code.":::

> [!TIP]
> You can zoom the histogram using the mouse scroll wheel or a trackpad gesture. When zoomed in, you can pan the chart by pressing 'Alt' while scrolling.

## Visualize the quantum circuit

Quantum circuit diagrams are a visual representation of quantum operations. They show the flow of qubits through the quantum program, including the gates and measurements applied to them. For more information, see [Quantum circuit diagrams in Visual Studio Code](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.visualize-circuits#quantum-circuits-with-visual-studio-code).

1. Select **View -> Command Palette** and type “circuit” which should bring up the **Q#: Show circuit** option. You can also click on **Circuit** from the list of commands below `@EntryPoint()`.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/codelens-circuit.png" alt-text="Screenshot the Q# file in Visual Studio Code showing where to find the code lens circuit command.":::

1. The circuit is displayed in the Q# circuit window. The circuit diagram shows one qubit register which it's initialized to the |0⟩ state. Then, a Hadamard gate, **H**, is applied to the qubit, followed by a [measurement operation](xref:microsoft.quantum.concepts.circuits#measurement-operator), which is represented by a meter symbol. For more information, see [Quantum circuits conventions](xref:microsoft.quantum.concepts.circuits).

## Connect to Azure Quantum and submit your job

You can connect and submit jobs directly from VS Code. For this example, you'll submit a job to the Rigetti simulator. 

1. Select **View -> Command Palette** and type **Q#: Connect to an Azure Quantum workspace**. Press **Enter**.
1. Select **Azure account**, and follow the prompts to connect to your preferred directory, subscription, and workspace.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have a connection string, you can select **Connection string** and paste the connection string corresponding to your Azure Quantum workspace. For more information, see [Connect to a Quantum workspace using a connection string](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.connect-workspace#connect-with-a-connection-string).

1. Once you are connected, in the **Explorer** pane, expand **Quantum Workspaces**.
1. Expand your workspace and expand the **Rigetti** provider.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If there is an issue connecting to Azure Quantum, a warning icon displays next to the workspace name. Hover over the workspace name to display error information. 

1. Select **rigetti.sim.qvm** as your target.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/vscode-add-rigetti.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code showing how to select Rigetti simulator as target.":::

1. Select the play icon to the right of the target name to start submitting the current Q# program. If you get a popup, select **Change the QIR target profile and continue**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/vscode-run-rigetti.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code showing how to run Rigetti simulator as target.":::

1. Add a name to identify the job.
1. Add the number of shots, or number of times that the program is run.
1. Press **Enter** to submit the job. The job status will display at the bottom of the screen.
1. Expand **Jobs** and hover over your job, which displays the times and status of your job.
1. To view the results, select the cloud icon next to the job name to download the results from your workspace storage and display it in VS Code.
