# Update the Azure Quantum Development Kit (QDK) to the latest version

Learn how to update the Azure QDK to the latest version.

## Prerequisites

- This article assumes that you already have the Azure QDK extension installed on Visual Studio Code. If you are installing for the first time, then please refer to the [installation guide](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview).

## Update the Visual Studio Code extension

By default, Visual Studio Code updates extensions automatically. After any updates, you are prompted to reload VS Code. If you prefer to disable auto-updates and update extensions manually, see [Extension auto-update](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_extension-autoupdate) in the VS Code documentation.

## Update the Azure Quantum Python packages

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are updating from a previous Qiskit environment, see [Update the azure-quantum package with Qiskit support in a virtual Python environment (recommended)](#update-the-azure-quantum-package-with-qiskit-support-in-a-virtual-python-environment-recommended).

1. Update to the latest `qsharp` and `azure-quantum` Python packages by using the package installer for Python (pip).
  
    ```cmd
    pip install --upgrade qsharp>=1.0
    ```

    ```cmd
    pip install --upgrade azure-quantum
    ```
### Update the azure-quantum package with Qiskit support in a virtual Python environment (recommended)

The azure-quantum Python package includes optional support for creating and submitting Qiskit circuits to Azure Quantum. When you install the azure-quantum package with Qiskit support, it installs the latest version of Qiskit, which may cause issues with an existing Qiskit environment. To ensure a stable development environment, we recommend creating a virtual Python environment and installing azure-quantum there. 

To create a virtual Python environment and install azure-quantum with Qiskit support:
1. Create a local folder, for example *~/qiskit10-env*.
1. Run `venv` with the path to the folder

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv ~/qiskit10-env
    ```

1. Activate the environment.

    ```bash
    ~/qiskit10-env/bin/activate
    ```

1. Run `pip list` and you can see that only the core packages are installed in the new environment.
1. To install the azure-quantum package, run

    ```bash
    pip install azure-quantum[qiskit]
    ```
1. Install any other packages that you used in your previous environment as needed. You can run `pip list` in each environment to compare packages and versions. 

> [!NOTE]
> See [Qiskit 1.0 packaging changes](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/migration-guides/qiskit-1.0-installation#qiskit-10-packaging-changes) for more information on package compatibility. 

> [!NOTE]
> You can also open your virtual environment in VS Code. From the **View** menu, select **Command Palette** > **Python: Create Environment** > **venv**. In the lower right, select **Open Folder...** and select the environment folder you created earlier.  For more information on using environments in VS Code, see [Python environments in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments).

### Update the azure-quantum package with Qiskit support in the current environment 

You can also update the azure-quantum package with Qiskit support without using a virtual environment. However, updates to the qiskit packages in an existing environment may cause dependency conflicts with other packages. See [Qiskit 1.0 packaging changes](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/migration-guides/qiskit-1.0-installation#qiskit-10-packaging-changes) for more information on package compatibility. 

To update the azure-quantum package:
1. Uninstall the existing azure-quantum and qiskit packages:

    ```cmd
    pip uninstall -y azure-quantum qiskit qiskit-terra qiskit-qir
    ```
1. Install azure-quantum using the optional [qiskit] parameter:

    ```cmd
    pip install azure-quantum[qiskit]
    ```
    
## Update the Azure CLI quantum extension

1. Update or install the latest Azure CLI `quantum` extension. From a Windows command prompt, run

    ```azurecli
    az extension add --upgrade --name quantum
    ```
