# IonQ provider

[!INCLUDE [Azure Quantum credits banner](includes/azure-quantum-credits.md)]

IonQ’s quantum computers perform calculations by manipulating the hyperfine energy states of Ytterbium ions with lasers. Atoms are nature's qubits — every qubit is identical within and between programs. Logical operations can also be performed on any arbitrary pair of qubits, enabling complex quantum programs unhindered by physical connectivity. Want to learn more?

IonQ Aria is available through Azure Quantum Credits plan and a separate billing plan. For more information, see [Azure Quantum pricing](/azure/quantum/pricing?tabs=tabid-aria%2Ctabid-AQcreditsQ%2Ctabid-payasgo%2Ctabid-learndevelop&pivots=ide-computing#ionq).

## Native gates support and usage

By default IonQ allows you to specify a quantum circuit using an abstract set of quantum gates, called `qis`, which allows flexibility and portability when writing an algorithm without worrying about optimization for the hardware.

However, in some advanced usage cases, you might want to define a circuit directly on native gates in order to be closer to the hardware and bypass optimization. The native gate set is the set of quantum gates that are physically executed in the quantum processor, and they map the circuit to those as part of the execution.

For more information, see [Getting Started With Native Gates (ionq.com)](https://ionq.com/docs/getting-started-with-native-gates).

In order to use the native gate set when submitting Qiskit jobs to Azure Quantum, you specify the `gateset` parameter when initializing the backend as in the example below:

```python
# Here 'provider' is an instance of AzureQuantumProvider
backend = provider.get_backend("ionq.qpu", gateset="native")
```

| Parameter Name | Type     | Required | Description |
|----------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `gateset`   | string    | No | Specifies the set of gates that will be used to define a circuit. A value of `qis` corresponds to the abstract gates (default behavior) and `native` to the [IonQ hardware native gates](https://ionq.com/docs/getting-started-with-native-gates#introducing-the-native-gates).|

For more information about Qiskit jobs, see [Submit a circuit with Qiskit using an Azure Quantum notebook](xref:microsoft.quantum.quickstarts.computing.qiskit.portal).

## Input format

In Q#, the output of a quantum measurement is a value of type `Result`, which can only take the values `Zero` and `One`. When you define a Q# operation, it can only be submitted to IonQ hardware if the return type is a collection of `Result`s, that is, if the output of the operation is the result of a quantum measurement. The reason for this is because IonQ builds a histogram from the returned values, so it restricts the return type to `Result`s to simplify creating this histogram.

IonQ's targets correspond to the [No Control Flow profile](xref:microsoft.quantum.target-profiles#create-and-run-applications-for-no-control-flow-profile-targets). This profile can't run quantum operations that require the use of the results from qubit measurements to control the program flow. 

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, you can't submit quantum programs that apply operations on qubits that have been measured in No Control Flow targets, even
> if you don't use the results to control the program flow. That is, No Control Flow targets don't allow mid-circuit measurements.
>
> For example, the following code can **not** be run on a No Control Flow target:
> ```qsharp
> operation MeasureQubit(q : Qubit) : Result { 
>    return M(q); 
> }
>
> operation SampleMeasuredQubit(q : Qubit) : Result {
>     H(MeasureQubit(q));
>     return M(MeasureQubit(q));
> }
> ```

## Output format

When you submit a quantum program to the IonQ simulator, it returns the histogram created by the measurements. The IonQ simulator doesn't sample the probability distribution created by a quantum program but instead returns the distribution scaled to the number of shots. This is most apparent when you submit a single shot circuit. You will see multiple measurement results in the histogram for one shot. This behavior is inherent to IonQ simulator, while IonQ QPU actually runs the program and aggregates the results.

## Pricing

To see IonQ billing plan, visit [Azure Quantum pricing](xref:microsoft.quantum.providers-pricing#ionq).

## Limits & Quotas

IonQ quotas are tracked based on the QPU usage unit, which is *qubit-gate-shot (QGS)*. The resource usage is credited against your account.

Every quantum program consists of $N$ quantum logical gates of one or more qubits, and is executed for a certain number of shots. The number of gate-shots is calculated by the following formula:

$$
QGS = N · C
$$

where:

- $N$ is the number of one- or two-qubit gates submitted
- $C$ is the number of execution shots requested

Quotas are based on plan selection and can be increased with a support ticket. To see your current limits and quotas, go to the **Credits and quotas** blade and select the **Quotas** tab of your workspace on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). For more information, see [Azure Quantum quotas](xref:microsoft.quantum.quotas).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using an [Azure Quantum Credits](xref:microsoft.quantum.credits) plan, and not a billing plan, the quotas information maps to your allocated credits. In that case, the quota lists the total number of credits you have received.
