# Adapting Qiskit samples to run on Azure Quantum

If you have some experience with quantum computing or are just starting, it is likely that you use some samples from [Qiskit.org](https://qiskit.org/). This article shows you how to adapt a Qiskit sample to run against any of the Azure Quantum backends. You can either download the sample or copy the code to a new notebook. 

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you donâ€™t have an Azure account, register for free and sign up for a [pay-as-you-go subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go).
- An Azure Quantum workspace. See [Create an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace).

## Open the Qiskit sample in Azure Quantum

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and select your Azure Quantum workspace.
1. In the left blade, select **Notebooks** and click **My Notebooks**.
1. Click **Upload New** if you've downloaded a sample, or click **Add New** to copy the code to a new notebook.
    - If you are creating a new notebook, select **IPython** as the **Kernel type**.

## Locate the default backend

Most samples are configured to run by default against the `aer_simulator`, which is a great way to get started. 

1. Locate the cell that has a line that defines the backend, for example, `backend = Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator')`.
1. Comment out that line.
1. If your sample **doesn't** have a default backend, you need to import the `QuantumInstance` class that will call the Azure Quantum backend. Copy the following code and paste it in a new cell *before* the Qiskit code sample. 

    ```python
    from qiskit import *
    from qiskit.utils import QuantumInstance
    ```

## Create an Azure Quantum backend

1. Click **+ Code** to add a new code cell *before* the code sample.
1. Replace the existing backend with an Azure Quantum backend. The following code configures an Azure Quantum backend from one of the providers available in your Azure Quantum workspace. For example, if you want to run the sample against a Quantinuum processor, use `backend = quantinuum_qpu_backend`. 

    ```python
    from azure.quantum.qiskit import AzureQuantumProvider
    provider = AzureQuantumProvider (
        resource_id = "", # Add the resourceID of your workspace
        location = "" # Add the location of your workspace (for example "westus")
    )

    # Create IonQ simulator and QPU backends
    ionq_simulator_backend = provider.get_backend("ionq.simulator")
    ionq_qpu_backend = provider.get_backend("ionq.qpu.aria-1")

    # Create Rigetti simulator and QPU backends
    rigetti_simulator_backend = provider.get_backend("rigetti.sim.qvm")
    rigetti_qpu_backend = provider.get_backend("rigetti.qpu.aspen-m-3")

    # Create Quantinuum simulator and QPU backends
    quantinuum_simulator_backend = provider.get_backend("quantinuum.sim.h1-2e")
    quantinuum_qpu_backend = provider.get_backend("quantinuum.qpu.h1-2")

    # Set your backend of choice
    backend = ionq_simulator_backend
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The location and resource ID of your workspace can be found in the **Overview** tab of your Azure Quantum workspace.

## Add a quantum instance (only if no default backend)

If the Qiskit sample doesn't have a default backend, you have to create a [`QuantumInstance`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance.html) object that uses the Azure Quantum backend that you created in the previous step.

As an example, consider the following Qiskit sample that uses a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) algorithm to train and test samples from a data set. You can find this code in [Qiskit/qiskit-machine-learning](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-machine-learning#creating-your-first-machine-learning-programming-experiment-in-qiskit). 

To run this sample on Azure Quantum, add this code after you have created the Azure Quantum backend, and add a line with `quantum_instance = QuantumInstance(backend)` when creating the VQC object.

> [!NOTE]
> To run the following sample you need to install Qiskit Machine Learning module.
> 
> ```python
> !pip install qiskit-machine-learning
> ```

## Verify the update

Click on **Run all** on the top left of the notebook and verify that you have jobs being queued under *Job management*.
