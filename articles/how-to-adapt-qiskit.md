# Adapting Qiskit samples to run on Azure Quantum

If you have some experience with quantum computing or just starting, it is likely that you use some samples from [Qiskit.org](https://qiskit.org/). This article shows you how to adapt a Qiskit sample to run against any of the Azure Quantum backends. You can either download the sample or copy the code of it. 

## Prerequisistes

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you donâ€™t have an Azure account, register for free and sign up for a [pay-as-you-go subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go).
- An Azure Quantum workspace. See [Create an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace).

## Open the Qiskit sample in Azure Quantum

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and select your Azure Quantum workspace.
1. In the left blade, select **Notebooks** and click **My Notebooks**.
1. Click **Upload New** if you've downloaded a sample, or click **Add New** to copy the code in a new notebook.
    - If you click **Add New**, in **Kernel Type**, select **IPython**.

## Locate the default backend

Most samples are configured to run by default against the `aer_simulator`, which is a great way to get started. 

1. Locate the cell that has a line like the following: `backend = Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator')`, or other backend.
1. Comment out that line.
1. If the sample **doesn't** have a default backend,  you need to import the `QuantumInstance` method that will call the Azure Quantum backend. Copy the following code and paste it in a new cell *before* the Qiskit code sample. 

    ```python
    from qiskit import *
    from qiskit.utils import QuantumInstance
    ```
## Create an Azure Quantum backend

1. Click **+ Code** to add a new code cell *before* the code sample. 
1. **Replace** the existing backend for an **Azure Quantum backend**. The following code creates an Azure Quantum backend from your Azure Quantum workspace, and replace the `backend` object by one of the Azure Quantum backends available. For example, if you want to run the sample against Quantinuum quantum procesor, write `backend = quantinuum_qpu_backend`. 

    ```python
    from azure.quantum.qiskit import AzureQuantumProvider
    provider = AzureQuantumProvider (
        resource_id = "", # The resourceID of your workspace
        location = "" # The location of your workspace (for example "westus")
    )

    # Create IonQ simulator and QPU backends
    ionq_simulator_backend = provider.get_backend("ionq.simulator")
    ionq_qpu_backend = provider.get_backend("ionq.qpu.aria-1")

    # Create Rigetti simulator and QPU backends
    rigetti_simulator_backend = provider.get_backend("rigetti.sim.qvm")
    rigetti_qpu_backend = provider.get_backend("rigetti.qpu.aspen-m-3")

    # Create Quantinuum simulator and QPU backends
    quantinuum_simulator_backend = provider.get_backend("quantinuum.sim.h1-2sc")
    quantinuum_qpu_backend = provider.get_backend("quantinuum.qpu.h1-2")

    # Set your backend of choice
    backend = ionq_simulator_backend
    ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > The location and resource ID of your workspace can be found in the **Overview** tab of your Azure Quantum workspace.

## Add a quantum instance (only if no default backend)

If the Qiskit sample doesn't have a default backend, you have to add a `QuantumInstance` with the Azure Quantum backend to the code.   

As an example, consider the following Qiskit sample that uses a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) algorithm to train and test samples from a data set. You can find this code in [Qiskit/qiskit-machine-learning](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-machine-learning#creating-your-first-machine-learning-programming-experiment-in-qiskit). 
To run this sample on Azure Quantum, you have to copy the code after the Azure Quantum backend, and add a line with `quantum_instance = QuantumInstance(backend)` when creating the VQC object.

## Verify the update

Click on **Run all** on the top left of the notebook and verify that you have jobs being queued under *Job management*.
