# Contribute to the Quantum Development Kit (QDK)

*Quantum Development Kit (QDK)* is more than a collection of tools for writing quantum programs.
It's part of a broad community that explores quantum computing, researches quantum algorithms, develops new quantum device applications, and attempts to make the most of quantum programming.
The QDK offers quantum developers from a wide range of backgrounds with the features they need. Contributions to the QDK improve developer tools. You can improve how tools are documented. You can also create new features and functionality that make the entire quantum programming community a better place to create and discover.
We're very thankful for your kind contributions, and for the opportunity to work with you to make our community the best that it can be.

In this guide, we provide advice on how to make your contributions to the broader quantum programming community as useful as possible.

## Building community

The first step to making valuable contributions is to be mindful of your community. Be respectful and act professionally towards your peers. This ensures that you are part of building the best, most welcoming community possible.

As a part of that effort, all QDK projects have adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
For more information, please see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or
contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

## What kinds of contributions help the quantum programming community?

Various types of contributions help the quantum programming community.
In this guide, we'll focus on three ways that are especially relevant to the QDK.
All of these are critical to building a quantum community that empowers people.
This is not an exhaustive list. We encourage you to explore other ways to help the community to build on the promise of quantum programming!

- **Reporting bugs.** The first step in fixing bugs and other kinds of problems is to identify them. If you've found a bug in the QDK, let us know. This helps us fix it and make a better tools.
- **Improving documentation.** Any documentation set can always be better. It can cover more details and be made more accessible.
- **Contribute code.** Of course, one of the most direct ways to contribute is by adding new code to the QDK.

The contributions listed above are all immensely valuable and they are appreciated by us.
In the rest of the guide, we'll offer advice on how to make various types of contribution.

## Where do contributions go?

The QDK includes a number of different pieces that all work together to create a platform for writing quantum programs.
These pieces find homes in repositories. So we must first find out where contributions belong.

- [**microsoft/Quantum**](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum): Samples and tools to get started with the QDK.
- [**microsoft/QuantumLibraries**](https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumLibraries): Standard and domain-specific libraries for the QDK.
- [**microsoft/QuantumKatas**](https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumKatas): Self-paced programming exercises for learning quantum computing and the Q# programming language.
- [**microsoft/qsharp-compiler**](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler): The Q# compiler, Visual Studio extension, and Visual Studio Code extension.
- [**microsoft/qsharp-runtime**](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime): Simulation framework, code generation, and simulation target machines for the QDK.
- [**microsoft/iqsharp**](https://github.com/microsoft/iqsharp): Jupyter kernel and Python host functionality for Q#, as well as Docker images for using IQ# in cloud environments.
- [**microsoft/qdk-python**](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-python): Python packages `qdk` and `azure-quantum`.
- [**microsoft/qsharp-language**](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-language): This is where new Q# features are developed and specified, and where you can share ideas and suggestions about the future evolution of the Q# language and core libraries.
- [**MicrosoftDocs/quantum-docs**](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/quantum-docs): Source code for the documentation published at [docs.microsoft.com](xref:microsoft.quantum.azure-quantum-overview).

> [!NOTE]
> We cannot accept code and documentation contributions in the [**microsoft/Quantum-NC**](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum-NC) repository at this time. We still appreciate when bugs are reported.

There are also a few other, more specialized repositories that focus on auxiliary functionality related to the QDK.

- [**msr-quarc/qsharp.sty**](https://github.com/msr-quarc/qsharp.sty): LaTeX formatting support for Q# syntax.
- [**microsoft/quantum-viz.js**](https://github.com/microsoft/quantum-viz.js): A tool for rendering quantum circuits using pure HTML, used in Q# Jupyter Notebooks.
