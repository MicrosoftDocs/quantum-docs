# Microsoft's quantum machine

Microsoft is on the path to deliver a quantum machine as part of the Azure Quantum service. You can read more about this journey on [this blog](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/quantum/2022/11/17/microsofts-quantum-machine-new-data-available-today/). This is part of a comprehensive plan to empower innovators with quantum solutions for breakthrough impact.

In 2022, Microsoft had a major scientific breakthrough that cleared a significant hurdle toward building a scaled quantum machine with topological qubits. While engineering challenges remain, this new discovery demonstrates a fundamental building block for its approach to scaled quantum computing. For more information about this scientific discovery, read the [blog](https://www.microsoft.com/research/blog/microsoft-has-demonstrated-the-underlying-physics-required-to-create-a-new-kind-of-qubit/), watch a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8CHms4ixYc), or read the [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02472) of the paper.

## View a Jupyter Notebook of the results

The Azure Quantum team has created a set of Jupyter Notebooks on the [azure-quantum-tgp GitHub site](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-quantum-tgp) which display all the analysis and plots that appear in the paper. From the GitHub page, you can also view the executed notebook results with nbviewer.
