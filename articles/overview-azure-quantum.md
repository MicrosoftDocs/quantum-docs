## The parts of Azure Quantum

Azure Quantum offers you two main paths of quantum solutions:

- [Quantum Computing](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.qdk-overview): Learn, experiment and prototype with a variety of quantum hardware providers to help you get ready for the future of scaled quantum machines. Unlike other solutions, you are not siloed to a single hardware technology, and you benefit from a full stack approach protecting your long-term investments. 
- [Optimization](xref:microsoft.quantum.optimization.concepts.overview.introduction): Develop solutions that help you reduce the cost of operation in a broad range of fields such as finance, energy cost, fleet management, scheduling, and more. 

With Azure Quantum and the [Quantum Development Kit toolset](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.q-sharp), you will be able to program your quantum algorithms and optimization solutions, then apply those quantum solutions within the existing Azure platform to achieve real-world impacts even before the development of a general-purpose quantum computer.

You can apply to the [Azure Quantum Credits program](https://microsoft.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3fl9dfFrkC3g0aG?aq_source=organic).

### Quantum enthusiasts

If you are a student or quantum enthusiast, Azure Quantum will make your interest in quantum computing evolve. You will broaden your learnings through the access to the most diverse set of quantum technologies, you will learn the basics of quantum computing and the quantum programming language Q#, and discover the areas where quantum computers have the potential to make a big impact.

## Why use quantum computing

Quantum computers harness the unique behavior of quantum physics—such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference—and apply it to computing. This introduces new concepts to traditional programming methods. Quantum effects empower quantum computers for calculating exponentially more information and solve more complicated problems. When designed to scale, quantum computers will have capabilities that exceed today's most powerful supercomputers. 

With Azure Quantum, you can make use of the advantages of quantum computing today, in a full-stack open cloud ecosystem with access to software, hardware, and pre-built solutions. Azure Quantum offers two types of solutions: quantum computing and optimization.

### Quantum computing

If you aim to simulate quantum mechanical problems, such as chemical reactions, biological reactions, or material formations, quantum computers work exceptionally well because they use quantum phenomena in their computation. Quantum computers can also aid to speed up progress in diverse areas such as financial services, machine learning, and unstructured data searches, where lots of calculations are needed.

With Azure Quantum, researchers and businesses can use quantum computing to model complex scenarios in risk management, cybersecurity, network analysis, data search, vaccine development, or materials science. To learn more about how you can use quantum computing and quantum algorithms, see [What is quantum computing?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.qdk-overview).  

### Optimization

Optimization is the process of finding the best solution to a problem given its desired outcome and constraints. Complex optimization problems exist across every industry: vehicle routing, supply chain management, scheduling, portfolio optimization, power grid management, and many others. Solving these real-world problems results in high-value benefits, such as reduced costs, accelerated processes, or reduced risks. 

In Azure Quantum, you can already implement optimization problems to run on various classical computing silicon solutions, such as CPU, FPGA, GPU, or custom silicon, faster than many other classical optimization techniques. 

On the other hand, simulating the quantum effects on classical computers has led to the development of new types of quantum solutions. **Quantum-Inspired Optimization** algorithms exploit some of the advantages of quantum computing on classical hardware, providing a speedup over traditional approaches.

Azure Quantum gives you access to a broad set of state-of-the-art quantum-inspired optimization algorithms developed by Microsoft and its partners. 

To learn more about the optimization solutions in Azure Quantum, see [What is optimization?](xref:microsoft.quantum.optimization.concepts.overview.introduction).

## What is Q\# and the Quantum Development Kit?

The Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (QDK) is an **open-source** development kit for Azure Quantum, that enables you to work both online with the service and offline. The QDK includes the [quantum programming language Q#](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.q-sharp), a high-level programming language that allows you to focus your work at the algorithm and application level to create quantum programs.

The QDK offers a set of tools that will assist you in the quantum software development process: 

- [Ready-to-use libraries](xref:microsoft.quantum.libraries.overview) to help you keep your code high-level, including both “standard” libraries that implement patterns common for a lot of quantum algorithms, and domain-specific libraries, such as chemistry and machine learning. 
- [Quantum computing simulators](xref:microsoft.quantum.machines.overview), so that you can run a small instance of your program and see what it does without actual hardware access. 
- Preview simulators that allow for simulating the behavior of Q# programs under the influence of noise and the stabilizer representation. 
- A [resource estimator](xref:microsoft.quantum.machines.overview.resources-estimator) that provides real world costs to run your solutions, for example, how many qubits you need and how long your program will take.

### Tools for developers

Developers will find familiar interfaces in the Azure Quantum services. The Quantum Development Kit includes extensions for [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.DevKit) and [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.quantum-devkit-vscode), and integration with [Jupyter Notebooks](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview.jupyter). Quantum developers that are already working in other development languages, such as Qiskit or Cirq, can also run their programs on Azure Quantum.
 
You can use Q# as standalone, in notebooks, and at the command-line or use a host language, the QDK supports interoperability with [Python](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview.python) and other [.NET languages](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview.cs). You can also formulate optimization solutions with the Azure Quantum optimization Python package. As quantum systems evolve, your code endures.

### Workflow of the quantum software development

The Quantum Development Kit is the development kit for the quantum-focused programming language Q#, and Azure Quantum is the quantum cloud platform. 

The following diagram shows the stages through which a quantum program goes from idea to complete implementation on Azure Quantum, and the tools offered by the QDK for each stage.

![qdk workflow](~/media/quantum-development-kit-flow-diagram.svg)

1. **Write your quantum code.** You can [create your Q# program](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview.standalone) using the QDK extensions for Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebooks.

2. **Use libraries to keep your code high level.** The [quantum libraries](xref:microsoft.quantum.libraries.overview) will help you keep your code high-level, doing a lot of the heavy lifting in implementation for you so that you can focus on the logic of your algorithms.

3. **Integrate with classical software.** The Quantum Development Kit allows you to [integrate Q# programs with Python and .NET](xref:microsoft.quantum.user-guide-qdk.overview.host-programs), enabling a quantum software developer to take advantage of a lot of the advances made in classical computing in the past 70 years.

4. **Run your quantum code in simulation.**  Once you’ve written your program, you’ll want to use [quantum simulators](xref:microsoft.quantum.machines.overview) – classical programs that simulate the behavior of a quantum system, so that you can run a small instance of your program and see what it does without actual hardware access.

5. **Estimate resources.**  Before running on quantum hardware, you’ll need to figure out whether your program can run on existing hardware. You can use [QDK resource estimators](xref:microsoft.quantum.machines.overview.resources-estimator) to tell you how many qubits you need and how long your program will take.

6. **Run your code on quantum hardware.** Finally, the last step is using [Azure Quantum](xref:microsoft.quantum.submit-jobs) to run your program on quantum hardware!

> [!Note]
> You use the same Q# code for all steps of the workflow. In the short term you might have to tweak some portions of the code to account for the current hardware limitations. But in the long run you’ll be able to switch between various simulators and hardware providers without any code modifications.

## Quantum cloud solutions available on Azure Quantum

Once you’ve validated the correctness of your program and estimated that it is fit to run on the hardware you have access to, you are ready to submit your program to Azure Quantum. The following diagram shows the basic workflow after you submit your job:
