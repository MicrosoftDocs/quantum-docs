# What is Azure Quantum?

Azure Quantum is the cloud quantum computing service of Azure, with a diverse set of quantum solutions and technologies. Azure Quantum ensures an open, flexible, and future-proofed path to quantum computing that adapts to your way of working, accelerates your progress, and protects your technology investments.

Azure Quantum provides the best development environment to create quantum algorithms for multiple platforms at once while preserving flexibility to tune the same algorithms for specific systems. You can write your code once and run it with little to no change against multiple targets of the same family which allows you to focus your programming at the algorithm level.

To learn more about how you can use quantum computing and quantum algorithms, see [Understanding Quantum Computing](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.understanding).

## How to get started with Azure Quantum?

There are different ways to get started with Azure Quantum. You can start by exploring the Azure Quantum website, or you can create your first Azure Quantum workspace.

### The Azure Quantum website

[Azure Quantum (quantum.microsoft.com)](https://quantum.microsoft.com/) is a central resource for exploring quantum computing. You can engage with the Copilot in Azure Quantum, a quantum-focused chatbot that helps you write code and better understand quantum concepts. You can also learn from experts and enthusiasts through blogs, articles and videos.

Try out Q# code samples in the online code editor, [Code with Azure Quantum](https://quantum.microsoft.com/experience/quantum-coding), submit your job the to the cloud-based Quantinuum H-Series Emulator, or with one click in the online code editor, open your code in [VS Code for the Web](https://vscode.dev/quantum) and continue working in a pre-configure quantum environment.

The Azure Quantum website is **free** of charge and **doesn't require** an Azure account. To get started, all you need is a Microsoft (MSA) email account. For more information, see [Explore Azure Quantum](xref:microsoft.quantum.get-started.azure-quantum).

### The Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [Azure Quantum credits banner](includes/azure-quantum-credits.md)]

Start using Azure Quantum is very easy and free of cost for new users. To submit your quantum programs to Azure Quantum you only need two things:

- **An Azure account**: If you donâ€™t have an Azure account, register for free and sign up for a [pay-as-you-go subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go). If you are a student, you can take advantage of a [free Azure account for students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/).

- **An Azure Quantum workspace**: An Azure Quantum workspace is a collection of assets associated with running quantum. To create an Azure Quantum workspace, go to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.AzureQuantum), select **Quick create** and it automatically creates the workspace and adds the default providers. Or select **Advance create**, and enter the details of your workspace and choose the providers.

For more information, see [Create an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace).

## What is Q\#?

Q# is an open-source quantum programming language for developing and running quantum programs.

A quantum program can be seen as a particular set of classical subroutines which, when called, perform a computation by interacting with a quantum system; a program written in Q# does not directly model the quantum state, but rather describes how a classical control computer interacts with qubits. This allows you to be entirely agnostic about what a quantum state even *is* on each target machine, which might have different interpretations depending on the machine.

Q# is a standalone language offering a high level of abstraction. There is no notion of a quantum state or a circuit; instead, Q# implements programs in terms of statements and expressions, much like classical programming languages. Thus, the Q# language supports the integration of rich classical and quantum computing.

For more information, see [Introduction to Q#](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp-overview).

## How can I write Q# quantum programs?

Azure Quantum offers the **Azure Quantum Development Kit (QDK)**. With the QDK, you can write Q# quantum programs, debug your code, get real-time code feedback, and choose your target machine. The QDK is the only development kit ready for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC). 

The QDK offers two ways to run your quantum programs on Azure Quantum:

- Online development: Write your quantum code in the [online code editor](https://quantum.microsoft.com/experience/quantum-coding), and in [Visual Studio Code for the Web](https://vscode.dev/quantum).
- Local development: Install the  QDK extension for Visual Studio Code and write your quantum code locally. For more information, see [Installing the QDK on VS Code](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview#installing-the-qdk-on-vs-code).

Besides supporting for Q#, the QDK offers support for Qiskit and Cirq for quantum computing, so if you are already working in other development languages, you can also run your circuits on Azure Quantum.

> [!NOTE]
> An Azure Quantum workspace is required to run your local quantum programs on Azure Quantum providers. For more information, see [Create an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace).

## What is hybrid quantum computing?

Hybrid quantum computing refers to the processes and architecture of a classical computer and a quantum computer working together to solve a problem. With the latest generation of hybrid quantum computing architecture available in Azure Quantum you can start programming quantum computers by mixing classical and quantum instructions together. 

For more information, see [Hybrid quantum computing](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.hybrid).

## Resource estimation in quantum computing

In quantum computing, resource estimation is the ability to understand the resources, that is the number of qubits, number of quantum gates, processing time, etc., that will be required for a given algorithm, assuming (or taking as parameters) certain hardware characteristics. Understanding the number of qubits required for a quantum solution and the differences between qubit technologies allows innovators to prepare and refine their quantum solutions to run on future scaled quantum machines and ultimately accelerate their quantum impact.

Designed specifically for scaled quantum fault-tolerant error-corrected systems, the [Azure Quantum Resource Estimator](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.intro-resource-estimator) allows you to assess architectural decisions, compare qubit technologies, and determine the resources needed to execute a given quantum algorithm. You can choose from pre-defined fault-tolerant protocols and specify assumptions of the underlying physical qubit model. 

The Azure Quantum Resource Estimator computes post-layout physical resource estimation by taking a set of inputs such as qubit parameters, the quantum error correction (QEC) code, the error budget, and [other parameters](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.resources-estimator) into account. It takes a [Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR)](xref:microsoft.quantum.concepts.qir) program as input and, therefore, supports any language that translates to QIR, for example, you can use the Azure Quantum Resource Estimator with Q# and Qiskit.
