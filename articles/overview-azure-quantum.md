You don't need to have an Azure account to use Azure Quantum. But, if you want to submit your quantum programs to real quantum hardware in Azure Quantum, then you need to have an Azure account and an Azure Quantum workspace.

To get an Azure account, register for free and sign up for a [pay-as-you-go subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go). If you're a student, then you can take advantage of a [free Azure account for students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?cid=msft_learn).

### The Microsoft Quantum website

The [Microsoft Quantum website](https://quantum.microsoft.com/) is a central resource where you can explore quantum computing. You can engage with Copilot in Azure Quantum, a quantum-focused AI agent that helps you write code and better understand quantum concepts. You can also learn from experts and enthusiasts through blogs, articles, and videos.

You can try out Q# code samples in the [online code editor](https://quantum.microsoft.com/tools/quantum-coding), submit your code to the cloud-based Quantinuum Emulator, and open your code in [VS Code for the Web](https://vscode.dev/quantum) to work in a pre-configured quantum environment.

The Microsoft Quantum website is free to use and doesn't require an Azure account. To get started, you need only a Microsoft (MSA) email account. For more information, see [Explore Copilot in Azure Quantum](xref:microsoft.quantum.get-started.azure-quantum).

### Visual Studio Code

Azure Quantum offers the Quantum Development Kit (QDK), a software development kit designed specifically for quantum development. With the QDK, you can write programs in different quantum programming languages, debug your code, get real-time code feedback, and submit jobs to real quantum hardware through Azure Quantum. The QDK supports Microsoft's Q# programming language, along with other languages like Qiskit, Cirq, and OpenQASM.

The Quantum Development Kit is free and open source. To get started, install the QDK extension in VS Code. For more information, see [Set up the QDK extension](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview).

> [!NOTE]
> An Azure Quantum workspace is required to run your local quantum programs on Azure Quantum provider hardware. For more information, see [Create an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace).

### The Azure portal

If you have an Azure account, then use the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.AzureQuantum) to create an Azure Quantum workspace. An Azure Quantum workspace is a collection of assets that are associated with running  quantum programs. For more information, see [Create an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace).

With the Azure portal, you can submit your quantum programs to real quantum hardware, manage your Azure Quantum workspace, view information about your quantum jobs, and monitor your quantum programs.

## What is Q\#?

Q# is an open-source quantum programming language created by Microsoft to develop and run your quantum programs.

You can think of a quantum program as a set of classical subroutines that interact with a quantum system to perform a computation. A Q# program doesn't directly model the quantum state, but rather describes how a classical control computer interacts with qubits. In other words, Q# is hardware-agnostic, so you don't need to consider actual qubit technologies when you write Q# programs. Your Q# code will run on any quantum hardware technology.

Q# is a standalone language that offers a high level of abstraction. There's no notion of a quantum state or circuit. Instead, Q# implements programs in terms of statements and expressions, much like classical programming languages. You can seamlessly integrate classical and quantum computing structures in your Q# code.

For more information, see [Introduction to Q#](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp-overview). To start writing Q# code, see [Create your first Q# program](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp-quickstart).

## What can I do with Azure Quantum?

Azure Quantum offers a wide range of services and tools to help you develop quantum solutions.

For the latest information about Microsoft's quantum computing research, see the [Microsoft Research Quantum Computing](https://www.microsoft.com/research/research-area/quantum-computing/?) page.

### Hybrid quantum computing

Hybrid quantum computing refers to the processes and architecture of a classical computer and a quantum computer working together to solve a problem. With the latest generation of hybrid quantum computer architecture available in Azure Quantum, you can get started with a classical-quantum hybrid approach to programming.

For more information, see [Hybrid quantum computing](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.hybrid).

### Resource estimation in quantum computing

In quantum computing, resource estimation is the ability to understand the resources that are required to run an algorithm on a quantum computer. When you understand the resource requirements to run your programs on different types of quantum hardware, you can prepare and refine your quantum solutions to run on future scaled quantum machines. For example, the Resource Estimator can estimate the resources needed to break a particular encryption algorithm.

The [Azure Quantum Resource Estimator](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.intro-resource-estimator) allows you to assess architectural decisions, compare qubit technologies, and determine the resources that you need to run a given quantum algorithm. You can choose from pre-defined fault-tolerant protocols, or set your own estimation parameters. The Azure Quantum Resource Estimator computes post-layout physical resource estimates given a set of inputs such as qubit parameters, the quantum error correction (QEC) code, the error budget, and [other parameters](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.resources-estimator).

To get started, see [Run your first resource estimate](xref:microsoft.quantum.quickstarts.computing.resources-estimator).

### Quantum chemistry simulations with Azure Quantum

Quantum mechanics is like the underlying operating system of our universe, and describes how the fundamental building blocks of nature behave. Chemical reactions, cellular processes, and material properties are all quantum mechanical in nature, and often involve interactions between a huge number of quantum particles. Quantum computers have promise to simulate intrinsically quantum mechanical systems, such as molecules, because qubits can be used to represent the natural quantum states in these systems. Examples of quantum systems that we can model include photosynthesis, superconductivity, and complex molecular formations.

The QDK and Azure quantum are purpose-built to accelerate scientific discovery. Reinvent your research and development productivity with simulation workflows that are optimized for scaling on Azure high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, AI-accelerated computing, integration with quantum tools and quantum hardware, and future access to Microsoftâ€™s quantum supercomputer.

For more information, see [Unlocking the power of Azure for Molecular Dynamics](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/quantum/2023/06/01/unlocking-the-power-of-azure-for-molecular-dynamics/).

### Quantum speedup

Quantum computers do exceptionally well with problems that require calculations of a large number of possible combinations. These types of problems can be found in many areas, such as quantum simulation, cryptography, quantum machine learning, and search problems.

One of the goals of quantum computing research is to study what kinds of problems can be solved by a quantum computer faster than a classical computer, and how large the speedup can be. One well-known example is Grover's algorithm, which yields a polynomial speedup over the classical counterparts.

[Grover's algorithm](xref:microsoft.quantum.concepts.grovers) speeds up the solution to unstructured data searches, running the search in fewer steps than any classical algorithm could. Indeed, any problem that allows you to check whether a given value $x$ is a valid solution (a "yes or no problem") can be formulated in terms of the search problem.

For an implementation of Grover's algorithm, see [Tutorial: Implement Grover's search algorithm in Q#](xref:microsoft.quantum.tutorial-qdk.grovers).
