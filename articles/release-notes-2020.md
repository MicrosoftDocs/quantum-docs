# Release notes for Quantum Development Kit (QDK) and Azure Quantum - 2020

This article outlines updates to the [Quantum Development Kit (QDK)](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview) and the [Azure Quantum service](xref:microsoft.quantum.azure-quantum-overview) in 2020.

## QDK version 0.14.2011120240

### 2020-11-25

- Improved compiler performance with faster reference loading.
- Added an [ANTLR grammar for Q#](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-language/tree/main/Specifications/Language/5_Grammar) to the Q# language specification.
- Updated the `Microsoft.Quantum.Preparation` namespace so it is more consistent with style guide and API design principles, and to support purified mixed states with more data (see [proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/issues/344), [review notes](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/blob/main/Design/meetings/2020/api-design-2020-11-05.md), and PRs [#212](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/pull/212), [#322](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/pull/322), [#375](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/pull/375), [#376](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/pull/376)).
- Parentheses around repeated call expressions are now optional: `(Foo(x))(y)` may be written as `Foo(x)(y)`.
- Users of the Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code extensions who have installed .NET 5 or Visual Studio 16.8 may be prompted to install .NET Core 3.1 to continue to work with the extensions.

## QDK version 0.13.20111004

### 2020-11-10

This release disables IntelliSense features for Q# files in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code when a project file isn't present. This resolves an issue where IntelliSense features may stop working after adding a new Q# file to a project (see [qsharp-compiler#720](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/720)).

## QDK version 0.13.20102604

### 2020-10-27

This release contains the following:

- Resource estimation now emits simultaneously achievable depth and width estimates also to the qubit count.

## QDK version 0.12.20082513

### 2020-08-25

- Improved Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics namespace with new `DumpOperation` operation, and new operations for restricting qubit allocation and oracle calls. ([QuantumLibraries#302](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/pull/302))
- New `%project` magic command in Q# and `qsharp.projects` API in Python to support references to Q# projects outside the current workspace folder. See [iqsharp#277](https://github.com/microsoft/iqsharp/issues/277) for the current limitations of this feature.
- Support for automatically loading `.csproj` files for IQ#/Python hosts, which allows external project or package references to load at initialization time. For more information, see the guide for using Q# with Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## QDK version 0.12.20072031

### 2020-07-21

This release contains the following:

- Opened namespaces in Q# notebooks are now available when running all future cells. This allows, for example, namespaces to be opened once in a cell at the top of the notebook, rather than needing to open relevant namespaces in each code cell. A new `%lsopen` magic command displays the list of currently opened namespaces.

## QDK version 0.12.20070124

### 2020-07-02

This release contains the following:

- New `qdk-chem` tool for converting legacy electronic structure problem serialization formats (for example, FCIDUMP) to Broombridge.
- New functions and operations in the `Microsoft.Quantum.Synthesis` namespace for coherently applying classical oracles using transformation- and decomposition-based synthesis algorithms.
- IQ# now allows arguments to the `%simulate`, `%estimate`, and other magic commands.
- New phase display options in IQ#.
- IQ# and the `qsharp` Python package are now provided via conda packages ([qsharp](https://anaconda.org/quantum-engineering/qsharp) and [iqsharp](https://anaconda.org/quantum-engineering/iqsharp)) to simplify local installation of Q# Jupyter and Python functionality to a conda environment. For more information, see the [Q# with Python](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview) installation guides.
- When using the simulator, qubits no longer need to be in the |0‚ü© state upon release, but can be automatically reset if they were measured immediately before releasing.
- Updates to make it easier for IQ# users to consume library packages with different QDK versions, requiring only major & minor version numbers match rather than the exact same version
- Removed deprecated `Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive.*` namespace
- Moved operations:
  - `Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic.Assert` is now `Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics.AssertMeasurement`
  - `Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic.AssertProb` is now `Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics.AssertMeasurementProbability`
- Bug fixes
