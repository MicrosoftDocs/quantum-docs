# How to submit a circuit with Cirq to Azure Quantum

Learn how to submit a Cirq quantum circuit using the `azure-quantum` Python package. You can submit Cirq circuits to Azure Quantum using the Azure Quantum notebook, which have built-in `azure-quantum` Python package, or from your local machine.

For more information, see [Quantum circuits](xref:microsoft.quantum.concepts.circuits).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Submitting multiple circuits on a single job is currently not supported. As a workaround you can call the `backend.run` method to submit each circuit asynchronously, then fetch the results of each job. For example:
>
> ```python
> jobs = []
> for circuit in circuits:
>     jobs.append(backend.run(circuit, shots=N))
> 
> results = []
> for job in jobs:
>     results.append(job.result())
>```
