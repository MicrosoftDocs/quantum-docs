# Tutorial: Explore quantum entanglement with Q\#

In this tutorial, you write a Q# program that manipulates and measures qubits and demonstrates the effects of superposition and entanglement. You prepare two qubits in a specific quantum state, learn how to operate on qubits with Q# to change their state, and demonstrate the effects
of superposition and entanglement. You build your Q# program piece-by-piece to introduce qubit states, operations, and measurements.

Here are some key concepts to understand before you begin:

* Where classical bits hold a single binary value such as a 0 or 1, the state of a qubit can be in a superposition of two quantum states, 0 and 1. Each possible quantum state has an associated probability amplitude.
* The act of measuring a qubit produces a binary result with a certain probability, and changes the state of the qubit out of superposition. 
* Multiple qubits can be entangled such that they can't be described independently from each other. That is, whatever happens to one qubit in an entangled pair also happens to the other qubit.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

> * Create Q# operations to initialize a qubit to a desired state.
> * Put a qubit in superposition.
> * Entangle a pair of qubits.
> * Measure a qubit and observe the results.
