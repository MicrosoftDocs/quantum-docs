# Tutorial: Simulate quantum chemistry calculations for benzene diradical with QDK Chemistry in VS Code

In this tutorial, you work through an end-to-end quantum chemistry calculation for benzene diradical with the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (QDK) in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). You learn how to perform a series of classical quantum chemistry calculations, prepare a quantum circuit for your molecule, run the quantum circuit on different simulators, and visualize the results of your molecular calculations and quantum circuit.

## Prerequisites

To do this tutorial, you must install the following:

- VS Code with the QDK and Jupyter extensions [LINKS TO INSTALLATION DOCS]
- A Python environment with Python version 3.9 or higher.
- The latest version of the `qdk` Python library with the `jupyter` extra

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade "qdk[jupyter]" 
    ```
