# Add or remove a provider

Providers are usually added to an Azure Quantum workspace when the workspace is created. However, additional providers can be added (or existing providers removed) anytime after that. If you submit a quantum job to a provider that is not yet in your workspace, you will receive an error message prompting you to install the necessary provider.
 
To add a provider to an existing workspace: 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), using the credentials for your Azure subscription.
2. Select **Home** and navigate to your Azure Quantum workspace.
3. Select **Providers**. All your current providers are listed.
4. Select **Add a Provider**. All the available providers are displayed in **Add additional providers**, along with pricing information.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the provider you want to add is not in the list of available providers, then your billing account may be located in a country/region that is not supported by that provider. For more information, see [Global availability of Azure Quantum providers](xref:microsoft.quantum.provider-availability).

5. Select **+Add** next to the desired provider, select a pricing option, and then click **Add**. 
6. Once the provider is deployed, it appears in your provider list. To ensure that the deployment is complete, wait until the **Status** for the provider displays a green checkmark. 
7. If the deployment fails, review the notification or check the Activity log. 

To remove a provider from a workspace:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), using the credentials for your Azure subscription.
2. Select **Home** and navigate to your Azure Quantum workspace.
3. Select **Providers**. 
4. In the displayed list of providers, select **Remove** for the desired provider. 
1. Select **Yes** to remove the provider.
