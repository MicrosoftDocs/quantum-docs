# Qiskit and Cirq in the Quantum Development Kit

The Azure Quantum Development Kit (QDK) supports development in several quantum programming frameworks, including Qiskit and Cirq. Qiskit is developed by IBM and Cirq is developed by Google.

Both Qiskit and Cirq are Python libraries that offer tools to write, run, and analyze quantum programs. With the QDK, you can develop your quantum programs in these frameworks and then run your programs on the local simulator or submit them as jobs to Azure Quantum.

Explore the how-to guides to learn how to install and use Qiskit and Cirq with the QDK in Visual Studio Code.
