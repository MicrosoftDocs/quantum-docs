#Customer intent: As a developer, I want to learn about how the QDK supports other quantum programming frameworks, like Qiskit and Cirq.

# Qiskit and Cirq interoperability in the QDK

The Azure Quantum Development Kit (QDK) supports development in several quantum programming frameworks, including Qiskit and Cirq.

Qiskit and Cirq are Python libraries that offer tools to create and visualize quantum circuits and write quantum programs. The QDK supports some interoperability with both Qiskit and Cirq. You can write your quantum programs in these frameworks and then run your programs on the local simulator or submit them as jobs to Azure Quantum with the QDK.

## Get started with Qiskit and Cirq in the QDK

Install the Qiskit and Cirq libraries, and run Qiskit and Cirq circuits on Azure Quantum, through the `azure-quantum` Python SDK. You can also run Qiskit circuits on the QDK's local simulator.

To get started with Qiskit, see [How to submit a circuit with Qiskit to Azure Quantum](xref:microsoft.quantum.quickstarts.computing.qiskit).

To get started with Cirq, see [How to submit a circuit with Cirq to Azure Quantum](xref:microsoft.quantum.quickstarts.computing.cirq).
