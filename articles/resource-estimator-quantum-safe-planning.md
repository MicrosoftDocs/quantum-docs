title: Resource Estimator for Analyzing Cryptography
uid: microsoft.quantum.resource-estimator-cryptography

#customer intent: As a quantum developer, I want to use the Resource Estimator to estimate the resources needed for a future scaled quantum computer to break a particular encryption algorithm, so that I can analyze the impact of quantum computing on the security of some classical encryption methods and prepare for a quantum-safe future.

# Analyze cryptographic protocols with the Resource Estimator

The [Azure Quantum Resource Estimator](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.intro-resource-estimator) is available in [quantum.microsoft.com](https://quantum.microsoft.com/experience/quantum-cryptography) to estimate the resources needed for a future scaled quantum computer to break a particular encryption algorithm. This tool helps you to analyze the impact of quantum computing on the security of some classical encryption methods, and prepare for a quantum-safe future.

> [!NOTE]
> To access the Resource Estimator in [quantum.microsoft.com](https://quantum.microsoft.com/experience/quantum-cryptography) you only need a Microsoft account.

The Resource Estimator for quantum-safe planning takes a set of four target parameters as input:

- **Classical encryption algorithm,** which are Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
- **Key strength,** which are standard, enhanced, and highest.
- **Qubit type,** which are topological and superconducting.
- **Qubit error rate,** which are reasonable and optimistic.

## Use the Resource Estimator for quantum-safe planning

To use the Resource Estimator for quantum-safe planning, go to [Azure Quantum website (quantum.microsoft.com)](https://quantum.microsoft.com/experience/quantum-cryptography). 

1. Click on the **arrows** to switch between different selections of preset input parameters. See that the fields are populated for you.
1. Click **Ask Copilot**  if you want to know more about the resource estimation data.
1. Click **Download** to download the plot of the resource estimation job.
1. You can also **customize the parameters** of the encryption algorithm. You need to select *at least* one option for each input parameter. You can select multiple combinations of parameters and compare their security against quantum computers.
1. The results are displayed in a **plot** that shows the number of qubits and the runtime that a quantum computer with the selected architecture would need to break the encryption algorithm. **Hover over** the points of the plot to see more information about the resource estimates.
1. At any point, you can **ask Copilot a question** about cryptography, resource estimation, or quantum computing.
