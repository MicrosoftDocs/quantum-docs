## QDK version 0.6.1905

### 2019-05-03

This release contains the following:

- Makes changes to the Q# language
- Restructures the Quantum Development Kit libraries
- Adds new samples
- Fixes bugs.  Several closed PRs for [libraries](https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumLibraries/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) and [samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed).  

The changes are summarized here and instructions for upgrading your existing programs.  You can read more about these changes on devblogs.microsoft.com/qsharp.

#### Q# language syntax

This release adds new Q# language syntax:

- Add a [shorthand way to express specializations of quantum operations](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp.specializationdeclarations) (control and adjoints) with `+` operators.  The old syntax is deprecated.  Programs that use the old syntax (for example, `: adjoint`) continue to work, but a compile-time warning is generated.  
- Add a new ternary operator for [copy-and-update](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp.copyandupdateexpressions#copy-and-update-expressions), `w/` `<-`, can be used to express array creation as a modification of an existing array.
- Add the common [apply-and-reassign statement](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp.variabledeclarationsandreassignments#evaluate-and-reassign-statements), for example, `+=`, `w/=`.
- Add a way to specify a short name for namespaces in [open directives](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp.namespaces#open-directives).

With this release, we no longer allow an array element to specify on the left side of a set statement.  This is because that syntax implies that arrays are mutable when in fact, the result of the operation has always been the creation of a new array with the modification.  Instead, a compiler error is generated with a suggestion to use the new copy-and-update operator, `w/`, to accomplish the same result.  

#### Library restructuring

This release reorganizes the libraries to enable their growth in a consistent way:

- Renames the Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive namespace  to Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic.  These operations are implemented by the target machine.  The Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive namespace is deprecated.  A runtime warning advises when programs call operations and functions using deprecated names.

- Renames the Microsoft.Quantum.Canon package to Microsoft.Quantum.Standard.  This package contains namespaces that are common to most Q# programs.  This includes:  
  - Microsoft.Quantum.Canon for common operations
  - Microsoft.Quantum.Arithmetic for general purpose arithmetic operations
  - Microsoft.Quantum.Preparation for operations used to prepare qubit state
  - Microsoft.Quantum.Simulation for simulation functionality

With this change, programs that include a single "open" statement for the namespace Microsoft.Quatum.Canon may find build errors if the program references operations that were moved to the other three new namespaces.  Adding the additional open statements for the three new namespaces is a straightforward way to resolve this issue.  

- Several namespaces have been deprecated as the operations within have been reorganized to other namespaces. Programs that use these namespaces continue to work, and a compile-time warning denotes the namespace where the operation is defined.  

- The Microsoft.Quantum.Arithmetic namespace has been normalized to use the LittleEndian user-defined type. Use the function BigEndianAsLittleEndian when needed to convert to little endian.  

- The names of several callables (functions and operations) have been changed to conform to the Q# Style Guide.  The old callable names are deprecated.  Programs that use the old callables continue to work with a compile-time warning.

#### New samples

We added a [sample of using Q# with F# driver](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/pull/164).  

**"Thank you!"** to the following contributor to our open code base at https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum. These contributions add to the rich samples of Q# code:

- Mathias Soeken ([@msoeken](https://github.com/msoeken)): Oracle function synthesis. [PR #135](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/pull/135).

#### Migrating existing projects to 0.6.1905.

See the [install guide](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview) to update the QDK.
  
If you have existing Q# projects from version 0.5 of the Quantum Development Kit, the following are the steps to migrate those projects to the newest version.

1. Projects need to upgrade in order.  If you have a solution with multiple projects, update each project in the order they're referenced.
2. From a command prompt, Run `dotnet clean` to remove all existing binaries and intermediate files.
3. In a text editor, edit the `.csproj` file to change the version of all the `Microsoft.Quantum` `PackageReference` to version 0.6.1904, and change the `Microsoft.Quantum.Canon` package name to `Microsoft.Quantum.Standard`, for example:

    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Quantum.Standard" Version="0.6.1905.301" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Quantum.Development.Kit" Version="0.6.1905.301" />
    ```
4. From the command prompt, run this command: `dotnet msbuild`  
5. After running this, you might still need to manually address errors because of the changes listed above.  In many cases, these errors are also reported by IntelliSense in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
    - Open the root folder of the project or the containing solution in Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio Code.
    - After opening a `.qs` file in the editor, you should see the output of the Q# language extension in the output window.
    - After the project has loaded successfully (indicated in the output window), open each file and manually to address all remaining issues.

> [!NOTE]
> * For the 0.6 release, the language server included with the Quantum Development Kit does not support multiple workspaces.
> * In order to work with a project in Visual Studio Code, open the root folder containing the project itself and all referenced projects.
> * In order to work with a solution in Visual Studio, all projects contained in the solution must be in the same folder as the solution or in one of its subfolders.  
> * References between projects migrated to 0.6 and higher and projects using older package versions are **not** supported.
