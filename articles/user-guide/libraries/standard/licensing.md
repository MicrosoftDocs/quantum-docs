# Licensing #

The Quantum Development Kit is provided with an extensive collection of open-source functions and operations, licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).
The portions of the standard library that are portable across target machines can be obtained from the [Microsoft/QuantumLibraries](https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumLibraries) repository on GitHub, along with other libraries, such as the [quantum chemistry library](xref:microsoft.quantum.libraries.overview-chemistry.concepts.overview).

Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit also provides specialized library functions and operations that are licensed under a [Microsoft Research license](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum-NC/blob/main/LICENSE).
These can be obtained from the [Microsoft/Quantum-NC](https://github.com/microsoft/quantum-nc) repository on GitHub.

There are also many samples that explain and illustrate the use of functions and operations from the standard library and other libraries.
These samples are licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).
The samples can be obtained from the [Microsoft/Quantum](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum) repository on GitHub.
