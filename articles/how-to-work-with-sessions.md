# How to manage your sessions 

In this article, you learn how to manage your sessions. With sessions, you can group one or more jobs against a single target, which allows you to manage jobs effectively. For more information, see [Get started with sessions](xref:microsoft.quantum.hybrid.interactive).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you donâ€™t have an Azure account, register for free and sign up for a [pay-as-you-go subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/).
- An Azure Quantum workspace. For more information, see [Create an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace).
- A Python environment with [Python and Pip](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NRWMJP3717K) installed.
- The Azure Quantum `azure-quantum` package. If you want to use Qiskit or Cirq, you need to install the `azure-quantum` package with the \[qiskit\] or \[cirq\] tags. 

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade azure-quantum[qiskit] 
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Sessions are managed with Python, even when running Q# inline code.


## Monitoring sessions

You can use the **Job management** blade in your Quantum workspace to view all top-level submitted items, including sessions and individual jobs that aren't associated with any session.

1. Select the **Job management** blade in your Quantum workspace.
1. Identify the jobs of type **Session**. In this view you can see the Unique ID of a Session in column **Id** and monitor its **Status**. The states of a session are: 
   - **Waiting**: Jobs within the session are being executed. 
   - **Succeeded**: Session has ended successfully. 
   - **TimeOut**: If no new job is submitted within the session for 10 minutes, that session times out. For more information, see [Session timeouts](xref:microsoft.quantum.hybrid.interactive.how-to-sessions#session-timeouts).
   - **Failed**: If a job within a session fails, that session ends and reports a status of *Failed*. For more information, see [Job failure policy within sessions](xref:microsoft.quantum.hybrid.interactive.how-to-sessions#job-failure-policy-within-sessions).
1. Click on a session's name for more details.
1. You can see the list of **All jobs** within the session and monitor their status.

## Retrieving and listing sessions

The following table shows the Python commands to get the list of all sessions and all jobs for a given session. 

|Command| Description|
|---|---|
|[`workspace.list_sessions()`](xref:azure.quantum.Workspace) or `session.list_sessions()` | Retrieve a list of all sessions in a Quantum Workspace.|
|[`workspace.get_session(sessionId)`](xref:azure.quantum.Workspace) or `session.get_session(sessionId)` | Retrieve the session with ID `sessionId`. Each session has a unique ID. |
|[`workspace.list_session_jobs(sessionId)`](xref:azure.quantum.Workspace) or `session.list_session_jobs(sessionId)`  | Retrieve a list of all jobs in the session with ID `sessionId`. Each session has a unique ID.|

For example, the following code defines a function that gets a session with a minimum number of jobs. Then, for that session, it lists all the jobs, the total number of jobs, and the first 10 jobs. 

```python
def get_a_session_with_jobs(min_jobs):
    all_sessions = workspace.list_sessions() # list of all sessions
    for session in all_sessions:
        if len(workspace.list_session_jobs(session.id)) >= min_jobs:
            return session

session = get_a_session_with_jobs(min_jobs=3) # Get a Session with at least 3 jobs

session_jobs = workspace.list_session_jobs(session.id) # List of all jobs within Session ID

print(f"Job count: {len(session_jobs)} \n")
print(f"First 10 jobs for session {session.id}:")
for job in session_jobs[0:10]:
    print(f"Id: {job.id}, Name={job.details.name}")
```

## Manual methods of opening/closing sessions

We recommend following the steps in [Get started with sessions](xref:microsoft.quantum.hybrid.interactive#get-started-with-sessions) to create a new session. You can also manually create sessions.

### [Q# + Python](#tab/tabid-pythonsdk)

1. First, create a **Session object**.

      ```python
      from azure.quantum.job.session import Session, SessionDetails, SessionJobFailurePolicy
      import uuid
    
      session = Session(
          workspace=workspace, # required
          id=f"{uuid.uuid1()}", # optional, if not passed will use uuid.uuid1()
          name="", # optional, will be blank if not passed
          provider_id="ionq", # optional, if not passed will try to parse from the target
          target="ionq.simulator", # required
          job_failure_policy=SessionJobFailurePolicy.ABORT # optional, defaults to abort
          )
    
      print(f"Session status: {session.details.status}")
      ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > At this point, the session only exists on the client, and you can see that the status is **None**. To view the status of the session, you also need to create the session in the service.

1. To **create** a session in the service, you can use [`workspace.open_session(session)`](xref:azure.quantum.Workspace) or [`session.open()`](xref:azure.quantum.job.Session).
1. You can refresh the **status** and the session details with [`session.refresh()`](xref:azure.quantum.job.Session), or by getting a new session object from a session ID. 

      ```python
      same_session = workspace.get_session(session.id) 
      print(f"Session: {session.details} \n")
      print(f"Session: {same_session.details} \n")
      ```

1. You can **close** a session with [`session.close()`](xref:azure.quantum.job.Session) or [`workspace.close_session(session)`](xref:azure.quantum.Workspace).
1. To **attach the session** to a target, you can use `target.latest_session`.
1. You can **wait** for a session to be completed:

     ```python
    session_jobs = session.list_jobs()
    [session_job.id for session_job in session_jobs]
    
    import time
    while (session.details.status != "Succeeded" and session.details.status != "Failed" and session.details.status != "TimedOut"):
       session.refresh()
       time.sleep(5)
      ```

### [Qiskit](#tab/tabid-qiskit)

1. First, import the **credentials** of your Azure Quantum workspace.

    ```python
    import os
    resource_id = os.environ.get("AZURE_QUANTUM_RESOURCE_ID")
    location = os.environ.get("AZURE_QUANTUM_LOCATION")
    ```

1. Next, you create a **Provider object**.

    ```python
    from azure.quantum import Workspace
    from azure.quantum.qiskit import AzureQuantumProvider

    workspace = Workspace (
        resource_id = resource_id,
        location = location
    )

    provider = AzureQuantumProvider(workspace)
    ```

1. You create a **quantum backend** using the target you want to use. For example, the following code creates a quantum backend for IonQ simulator. For more information, see [Create an Azure Quantum backend](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.adapting-qiskit#create-an-azure-quantum-backend).

    ```python
    ionq_simulator_backend = provider.get_backend("ionq.simulator")
    provider_backend = ionq_simulator_backend
    backend_id = provider_backend.name()
    ```

1. To **create** a session object, you can use the `.open_session` function.

    ```python
    from azure.quantum.job.session import Session, SessionJobFailurePolicy
    session = provider_backend.open_session(name="Azure Quantum Session",
    job_failure_policy=SessionJobFailurePolicy.CONTINUE) # optional, defaults to abort
    session.open()
    
    print("Creating session")
    ```

1. To **attach the session** manually created to the quantum backend, you can use `session = provider_backend.latest_session`.
1. You can **retrieve** the jobs of your session using `session.list(jobs)`.
1. You can **close** a session with `session.close()`.
1. You can **wait** for a session to be completed:

    ```python
    print("Waiting for jobs to complete")
    
    import time
    while (session.details.status != "Succeeded" and session.details.status != "Failed" and session.details.status != "TimedOut"):
      session.refresh()
      time.sleep(5)
    print("Session status: " + session.details.status)
    ```

***

## Passing arguments in Q\#  

If your Q# operation takes input arguments, those arguments are passed during job submission, which is Python code. This means that you need to be careful to format your arguments as Q# objects.

When passing arguments as parameters to the job, they are formatted as Q# code when calling `qsharp.compile`, so the values from Python need to be formatted into a string as valid Q# syntax.

Consider the following Q# program, which takes an integer, `n`, and an array of angles, `angle`, as input.

```qsharp
open Microsoft.Quantum.Measurement;
open Microsoft.Quantum.Arrays;

operation GenerateRandomBits(n: Int, angle: Double[]) : Result[] {
   use qubits = Qubit[n]; // n parameter as the size of the qubit array
   for q in qubits {
       H(q);
   }
   R(PauliZ, angle[0], qubits[0]); // arrays as entry-points parameters
   R(PauliZ, angle[1], qubits[1]);
   let results = MeasureEachZ(qubits);
   ResetAll(qubits);
   return results;
}
```

You want to run `GenerateRandomBits` operation three times with `n=2` and different angles. You can use the following Python code to submit three jobs with different angles.

```python
angle = [0.0, 0.0]
with target.open_session(name="Q# session of three jobs") as session:
    target.submit(input_data=qsharp.compile(f"GenerateRandomBits(2, {angle})"), name="Job 1", shots=100) # First job submission
    angle[0] += 1
    target.submit(input_data=qsharp.compile(f"GenerateRandomBits(2, {angle})"), name="Job 2", shots=100) # Second job submission
    angle[1] += 1
    target.submit(input_data=qsharp.compile(f"GenerateRandomBits(2, {angle})"), name="Job 3", shots=100) # Third job submission

session_jobs = session.list_jobs()
[session_job.details.name for session_job in session_jobs]
```

In this example, because arrays in Python are already printed as \[item0, item1, ...\], the input arguments match the Q# formatting. For other Python data structures you might need more handling to get the string values inserted into the Q# in a compatible way. For example, a Q# tuple has to be in parentheses with comma separated values.

## Session timeouts

A session times out if no new job is submitted within the session for 10 minutes. The session reports a status of **TimedOut**. To avoid this situation, add a `with` block using `backend.open_session(name="Name")`, so the session `close()` is invoked by the service at the end of the code block. 

> [!NOTE]
> If there are errors or bugs in your program, it might take more than 10 minutes to submit a new job after the previous jobs in the session have all completed. 

The following code snippets show an example of a session times out after 10 minutes because no new jobs are submitted. To avoid that, the next code snippet shows how to use a `with` block to create a session. 

```python
#Example of a session that times out 

session = backend.open_session(name="Qiskit circuit session") # Session times out because only contains one job
backend.run(circuit=circuit, shots=100, job_name="Job 1")
```

```python
#Example of a session that includes a with block to avoid timeout

with backend.open_session(name="Qiskit circuit session") as session:  # Use a with block to submit multiple jobs within a session
    job1 = backend.run(circuit=circuit, shots=100, job_name="Job 1") # First job submission
    job1.wait_for_final_state()
    job2 = backend.run(circuit=circuit, shots=100, job_name="Job 2") # Second job submission
    job2.wait_for_final_state()
    job3 = backend.run(circuit=circuit, shots=100, job_name="Job 3") # Third job submission
    job3.wait_for_final_state()
```

## Job failure policy within sessions

The default policy for a session when a job fails is to end that session. If you submit an additional job within the same session, the service rejects it and the session reports a status of **Failed**. Any in progress jobs are canceled.

However, this behavior can be changed by specifying a job failure policy of `job_failure_policy=SessionJobFailurePolicy.CONTINUE`, instead of the default `SessionJobFailurePolicy.ABORT`, when creating the session. When the job failure policy is `CONTINUE`, the service continues to accept jobs. The session reports a status of **Failure(s)** in this case, which will change to **Failed** once the session is closed.

If the session is never closed and times out, the status is **TimedOut** even if jobs have failed. 

For example, the following program creates a session with three jobs. The first job fails because it specifies `"garbage"` as input data. To avoid the end of the session at this point, the program shows how to add `job_failure_policy=SessionJobFailurePolicy.CONTINUE` when creating the session. 

```python
#Example of a session that does not close but reports Failure(s) when a jobs fails

with target.open_session(name="JobFailurePolicy Continue", job_failure_policy=SessionJobFailurePolicy.CONTINUE) as session:
    target.submit(input_data="garbage", name="Job 1") #Input data is missing, this job fails
    target.submit(input_data=quil_program, name="Job 2") #Subsequent jobs are accepted because of CONTINUE policy
    target.submit(input_data=quil_program, name="Job 3")
```
