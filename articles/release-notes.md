- Added a new advanced sample that will help you explore the execution of hidden shift problems on a quantum computer.
- Prevented long waiting times by rejecting job submission if Target is in 'Unavailable' state.

## 2022-06-28

### QDK version 0.25.218240

- The latest version of the QDK has new magic commands for Q# Jupyter notebooks: [`%azure.target-capability`](/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.target-capability), [`%qir`](/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/qir). The new commands will allow you to target specific diagnostics and will show in each notebook cell if the target is set.
- We've improved the Q# compiler diagnostics in Jupyter notebooks. Upon cell compilation, the compiler will now point to lines that cause errors and warnings, and will also direct you to Q# documentation for the given error or warning message.
- This release also adds support for continuous-angle rotations to the open systems simulator (e.g. Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic.Rx and Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic.Exp), enabling the simulation of more Q# programs. See GitHub feature request [microsoft/qsharp-runtime#914](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime/issues/914) for more details.
- All Microsoft QIO CPU solvers now support [squared linear combination](/azure/quantum/optimization-slc-term) terms and [protobuf binary format](/azure/quantum/optimization-problem#input-problem-serialization-to-protobuf-binary-format). Additionally, several solvers now benefit from performance improvements, resulting in reduced memory usage and shortened runtimes. These solvers only use input format `microsoft.qio.v2`, the default format for all problems submitted via the Azure Quantum Python SDK.
- The latest update also enables calling [Parity()](/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.bitwise.parity) with a negative argument, fixing GitHub issue [microsoft/qsharp-runtime#993](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime/issues/993).
- We've added a new Azure CLI quantum extension, version 0.16.0
  - Lastly, any providers participating in the ‘Credits for All’ program will be automatically  added when you create a workspace with the CLI. See
[Azure Quantum Credits FAQ](/azure/quantum/credits-faq)

## 2022-05-23

### QDK version 0.24.210930

- In the May release, we've added names to access fields in `FixedPoint` user-defined type ([microsoft/QuantumLibraries#549](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/issues/549)).
- We've added two new operations `SubtractFxP` and `InvertFxP`. These will allow you to subtract and invert quantum fixed-point numbers, respectively  ([microsoft/QuantumLibraries#555](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/issues/555)).
- The release has added utility functions to convert between floating-point and fixed-point representation [microsoft/QuantumLibraries#559](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/issues/559).
- Lastly, we've fixed issue [microsoft/qdk-python#323](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-python/issues/323), addressing an apparent inconsistency in results returned by `job.result()` on a Qiskit job.

### Azure Quantum service update

- The latest service update streamlines advanced creation flow for Azure Quantum workspaces in the Azure Portal.
- We've updated the default storage account type to general-purpose v2 (from general-purpose v1) to support modern storage account offerings and features when managing data.

## 2022-04-29

### QDK version 0.24.208024

- New this month, we've added a [large simulation sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/tree/main/samples/getting-started/simulation)
demonstrating the use of the sparse simulator.
- The release also includes a new Azure CLI quantum extension, version 0.15.0
- We've fixed the following GitHub issues:
  - The QDK now includes improved processing of Qiskit job data in the Azure Quantum Python SDK. This enables VQE scenarios and Qiskit Experiment's StateTomography. This fixes GitHub issues: [microsoft/qdk-python#224](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-python/issues/224), [microsoft/qdk-python#258](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-python/issues/258), [microsoft/qdk-python#259](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-python/issues/259), and [microsoft/qdk-python#263](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-python/issues/263).
  - The release implements GitHub issue [microsoft/QuantumLibraries#442](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/issues/442). The QDK now provides two new operations for a concise shorthand to control operations with a single qubit: `SinglyControlled` and `SinglyControlledA` .
  - [microsoft/QuantumLibraries#367](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/issues/367)  changes how variants of operations are counted in [AllowAtMostNCallsCA](/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.allowatmostncallsca).
  - [microsoft/QuantumLibraries#546](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/issues/546) proposes an alternative for the use of `Default`, which is not advised.
 - [microsoft/QuantumLibraries#560](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/issues/560) addresses the wrong value being returned in the [MeasureFxP](/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.arithmetic.measurefxp) operation when the measurement value corresponds to the smallest representable fixed point.
  - [azure/azure-cli-extensions#4697](https://github.com/azure/azure-cli-extensions/issues/4697) in the Azure CLI extension, which allows setting a polling interval when waiting for an Azure Quantum job to complete.

### Azure Quantum service update

- The Azure portal now includes a [notebook](/azure/quantum/how-to-run-notebooks-workspace) for the [large simulation sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/blob/main/samples/getting-started/simulation/LargeSimulation.ipynb).

## 2022-03-30

### QDK version 0.24.201332

- In this month's release, we've added the [SparseSimulator](/azure/quantum/user-guide/machines/sparse-simulator) with discrete (sparse) states of the qubits. This simulator is more efficient for a class of quantum algorithms with a smaller number of states in superposition. It unlocks applications with a larger number of qubits than supported by QuantumSimulator.
- We've migrated the Quantum Development Kit from **.NETCore 3.1** to [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download), and raised the minimum supported version accordingly.
- The release also updates the [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.quantum-devkit-vscode) extension to support QDK versions based on .NET 6.
- There's a new marketplace extension: [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit for Visual Studio 2022](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.DevKit64) extension.
- The new QDK includes performance improvements made for Q# notebooks and Q# + Python workflows.
- There's a new Azure CLI quantum extension, version 0.14.0, that includes the following:
    - Extended error message in failed jobs to include details originated from the provider.
    - Support during workspace creation for all storage account types allowed in the Azure Quantum service.
- This release addresses the following GitHub issues:
  - [microsoft/qsharp-runtime#967](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime/issues/967) where decomposition of the [Exp operation](/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.exp)in Q# programs submitted to IonQ targets would use the incorrect angle convention resulting in incorrect rotation.
  -[microsoft/iqsharp#606](https://github.com/microsoft/iqsharp/issues/606) where lambda expressions couldn't be used in Q# programs that are called from Python, including Jupyter notebooks.
  - [microsoft/QuantumLibraries#511](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/issues/511) where the reflection phases for amplitude estimation were calculated incorrectly.
  -[microsoft/QuantumLibraries#527](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/issues/527) where the [RangeAsIntArray](/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.convert.rangeasintarray) function returned a wrong value for a corner case.
-[microsoft/QuantumLibraries#494](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/issues/494) where the [qdk-chem tool](xref:microsoft.quantum.libraries.overview-chemistry.concepts.installation#using-the-quantum-development-kit-with-qdk-chem) produced invalid Broombridge files.
  -[microsoft/QuantumLibraries#386](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/issues/386) where the [AllowAtMostNCallsCA](/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.allowatmostncallsca) operation failed non-deterministically.
  -[microsoft/qsharp-runtime#929](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime/issues/929) where the empty quantum program was causing an exception when submitted to Azure Quantum.
- [microsoft/QuantumLibraries#444](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/issues/444) where tests failed probabilistically.
  - Fixed GitHub issue [microsoft/QuantumLibraries#270](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/issues/270) where the number of qubits was overestimated in the [machine learning library](xref:microsoft.quantum.libraries.overview.machine-learning.intro).


### Azure Quantum service update

- We've [streamlined](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace) workspace creation and the navigation experience in Azure portal and have added a portal [notebook](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.notebooks) sample for the hidden shift scenario. 

## 2022-03-15

### QDK version 0.23.198514-beta (Preview)

- We've released [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit for Visual Studio 2022](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.DevKit64) as preview.

## 2022-03-02

### QDK version 0.23.195983

- This release addresses the following GitHub issues:
  - [microsoft/qsharp-compiler#1235](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/1235), Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code extensions no longer throw an unhandled exception if the .NET SDK isn't found. The Language Server will fall back to purely syntactic diagnostics.
  - Q# now supports lambda expressions. See the [Q# language documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/1113) for information about how to use them.
  - [microsoft/qsharp-compiler#1300](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/1300) - This fixes the issue where the Q# compiler would log an exception in addition to an error message for operations that return a non-unit type when incorrectly defined to be adjointable and/or controllable.
  - [microsoft/qsharp-compiler#1346](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/1346) - Fixes the issue where the Q# Formatter was removing parentheses around for-loop conditions without ensuring spacing around the condition.
  -[microsoft/qsharp-compiler#1289](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/1289) - Improves the usability of the Q# Formatter by outputting a summary of its changes to console and not overwriting unchanged files.
  - We've improved the error message you get when trying to run a sample before adding a provider to your Azure Quantum workspace ([link](https://aka.ms/AQ/Docs/AddProvider)) on how to add a new provider.
  - Breaking change: [microsoft/qdk-python#269](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-python/issues/269) - You can now pass `shots` to `backend.run` and `backend.estimate_cost` for all backends in the azure-quantum Python package.
  - [microsoft/qdk-python#248](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-python/issues/248) - This change applies to the Qiskit plugin of the azure-quantum Python package. The total number of counts in the histogram now matches the total number of shots.
  - We've removed the UserWarning when initializing a solver job sent to Toshiba SimulatedBifurcationMachine.
  - Breaking change: The compress flag was removed from problem, solvers and streaming_problem classes. The compress parameter can no longer be set in `solvers.problem` or `streaming_problem` objects and methods.
  - [microsoft/qsharp-compiler#1046](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/1046) and [microsoft/qsharp-compiler#1352](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/1352) - These fixes are related to QIR generation. The first fixes an issue when generating big integer literals with more than 64 bits. The second change addresses potential runtime failures caused by using a new array expression to create an array of callables.
  - We've added support for the [Quantinuum Provider](xref:microsoft.quantum.providers.quantinuum), which replaces the Honeywell Provider.
  - Breaking change: The QuantumSimulator has been refactored. If you use the `StateDumper::Callback()` directly, then you'll need to update that code.

#### Known Issues

- Q# lambda functions and operations don't compile properly in Q# Jupyter notebooks or from Q# + Python applications, as tracked by [microsoft/iqsharp#606](https://github.com/microsoft/iqsharp/issues/606).

- Updating the minimum required version for the Quantum Development Kit extensions to .NET 6.0.
- Q# Compiler uses LLVM 13 binaries for producing QIR.
- Released Microsoft Quantum Development Kit for Visual Studio Code .NET 6 Preview. (**Update:** *This extension preview has now been retired and its changes have been incorporated into the regular [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.quantum-devkit-vscode).*)

## 2022-01-26

### QDK version 0.22.187631

- The Full State Simulator has been migrated from the platform-specific compiler to Clang to fix [GitHub issue #876](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-runtime/issues/876). 
- When submitting a job to Azure Quantum via the CLI, Python, IQ# and other Azure Quantum SDKs, the job details may include the cost estimate of the job (if supported by the provider). The final cost on your bill might be slightly different due to added taxes and currency conversion rates. 
- You can now estimate the price of your job in azure-quantum package by using [estimate_cost](xref:microsoft.quantum.quickstarts.computing.provider.portal#estimate-job-cost) for the target that you're using with the Qiskit, Cirq and pass-through feature.
- The azure-quantum package now supports submitting Qiskit lists of length 1. 
- Fixed GitHub issue [microsoft/qdk-python#198](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-python/issues/198) in the azure-quantum package where the Qiskit jobs were causing incorrect results in circuits with helper qubits.
- In azure-quantum package, the perform_icm parameter of the 1QBit `PticmSolver` was deprecated, using it will now return a deprecation warning. A `seed` parameter was added to all other 1QBit solvers that specifies a random seed.
- Fixed GitHub issue [microsoft/qdk-python#178](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-python/issues/178) in the azure-quantum package so errors returned by the Azure Quantum service when using the Qiskit or Cirq feature are now propagated up.
- Fixed GitHub issue [microsoft/qsharp-compiler#1297](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/1297) where the IntelliSense information wasn't updated when the ExecutionTarget property was modified in the project file.

## 2021-12-14

### QDK version 0.21.2112.180703

- Released Azure CLI quantum extension version 0.11.0: Job result histograms will be left-aligned (not centered) in console output.

  - You need to update the QDK version in the `<Project>` tag of your `.csproj` file to use the Q# formatter.
  - You can use the Q# formatter via Visual Studio by clicking on the **Edit -> Advanced -> Format Document** menu item. Via Visual Studio Code, you can format your code by right-clicking on the code you want to format, and clicking on the **Format Document** menu item.
  - Added a build target, UpdateSyntax, for updating deprecated syntax in a Q# project. This target can be used with `dotnet msbuild -t:UpdateSyntax` at a command prompt.
  - Added Code Actions to automatically update deprecated syntax.
- Added support for submitting problems to a subset of Microsoft targets in [protobuf binary format](xref:microsoft.quantum.optimization.problem#input-problem-serialization-to-protobuf-binary-format). You can use it for encoding significantly larger problems by reducing the payload sizes, and improve upload and processing speeds.
- **Breaking change:** The [deserialize](xref:microsoft.quantum.optimization.problem#problemserialize) class method of the Problem class has a parameter name change from `problem_as_json` to `input_problem` to support deserialization of protobuf.

## 2021-10-26

### QDK version 0.20.2110.171573

- IQ# kernel [%azure.connect](/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.connect) command no longer sets "West US" as the default location. Location parameter is now required.
- The `azure-quantum` package now supports asynchronous I/O via the new `azure.quantum.aio` package. For more information, see [Solve a batch of problems](xref:microsoft.quantum.optimization.async-io).

- Refactored [QIR Runtime](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Quantum.Qir.Runtime) to use `intptr_t` for Qubit ID types consistently.
- Updated Azure CLI Extensions to version 0.9.0.

## 2021-09-28

### QDK version 0.19.2109.165653

- Added support for submitting [Cirq](/azure/quantum/quickstart-microsoft-cirq) and [Qiskit](/azure/quantum/quickstart-microsoft-qiskit) circuits to IonQ and Quantinuum.
- Conda packages have been moved from the quantum-engineering channel to the microsoft channel. When using conda to install the Quantum Development Kit for Q# notebook or Q# + Python usage, the `-c quantum-engineering` argument to conda should be changed to `-c microsoft`, and the `channels` section of environment.yml files should be updated. See the [getting started guide](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview) for the full install command using the new packages.
- You can formulate PUBO and Ising problems using [squared linear terms](/azure/quantum/optimization-slc-term) natively on the PA and SSMC solvers.
- Fixed [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/1089) with memory management and improved reliability for QIR generation: [1152](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/1152) and [1086](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/1086).
- Fixed [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-python/issues/147) related to `Workspace.get_targets()`. It now returns all available targets in the subscription, even those that don't have client-side support.
- Fixed issues with Q# compiler's diagnostics appearing in incorrect places: [1133](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/1133) and [1172](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/1172).
- **Breaking change:** The order of arguments in `ApplyIf`, `ApplyIfA`, `ApplyIfC`, and `ApplyIfCA` [has been changed](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/issues/377) to be consistent with related operations such as `ApplyIfElseB` and [Q# API design principles](/azure/quantum/contributing-api-design-principles).
- `Problem.serialize()` of the `azure.quantum.optimization` Python package now serializes the name of the Optimization Problem in a new optional metadata field, so you don't have to specify it again when deserializing the problem as detailed in this [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-python/issues/153).
- Released Azure CLI quantum extension version 0.8.0: Users will receive recommendation at most once a day, to update the az quantum extension if the version installed is out-of-date.

## 2019-05-03

### QDK version 0.6.1905

This release contains the following:

- Makes changes to the Q# language
- Restructures the Quantum Development Kit libraries
- Adds new samples
- Fixes bugs.  Several closed PRs for [libraries](https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumLibraries/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) and [samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed).  

The changes are summarized here and instructions for upgrading your existing programs.  You can read more about these changes on devblogs.microsoft.com/qsharp.

#### Q# language syntax

This release adds new Q# language syntax:

- Add a [shorthand way to express specializations of quantum operations](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp.specializationdeclarations) (control and adjoints) with `+` operators.  The old syntax is deprecated.  Programs that use the old syntax (for example, `: adjoint`) will continue to work, but a compile-time warning will be generated.  
- Add a new ternary operator for [copy-and-update](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp.copyandupdateexpressions#copy-and-update-expressions), `w/` `<-`, can be used to express array creation as a modification of an existing array.
- Add the common [apply-and-reassign statement](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp.variabledeclarationsandreassignments#evaluate-and-reassign-statements), for example, `+=`, `w/=`.
- Add a way to specify a short name for namespaces in [open directives](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp.namespaces#open-directives).

With this release, we no longer allow an array element to be specified on the left side of a set statement.  This is because that syntax implies that arrays are mutable when in fact, the result of the operation has always been the creation of a new array with the modification.  Instead, a compiler error will be generated with a suggestion to use the new copy-and-update operator, `w/`, to accomplish the same result.  

#### Library restructuring

This release reorganizes the libraries to enable their growth in a consistent way:

- Renames the Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive namespace  to Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic.  These operations are implemented by the target machine.  The Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive namespace is deprecated.  A runtime warning will advise when programs call operations and functions using deprecated names.

- Renames the Microsoft.Quantum.Canon package to Microsoft.Quantum.Standard.  This package contains namespaces that are common to most Q# programs.  This includes:  
  - Microsoft.Quantum.Canon for common operations
  - Microsoft.Quantum.Arithmetic for general purpose arithmetic operations
  - Microsoft.Quantum.Preparation for operations used to prepare qubit state
  - Microsoft.Quantum.Simulation for simulation functionality

With this change, programs that include a single "open" statement for the namespace Microsoft.Quatum.Canon may find build errors if the program references operations that were moved to the other three new namespaces.  Adding the additional open statements for the three new namespaces is a straightforward way to resolve this issue.  

- Several namespaces have been deprecated as the operations within have been reorganized to other namespaces. Programs that use these namespaces will continue to work, and a compile-time warning will denote the namespace where the operation is defined.  

- The Microsoft.Quantum.Arithmetic namespace has been normalized to use the <xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Arithmetic.LittleEndian> user-defined type. Use the function [BigEndianAsLittleEndian](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Arithmetic.BigEndianAsLittleEndian) when needed to convert to little endian.  

- The names of several callables (functions and operations) have been changed to conform to the [Q# Style Guide](xref:microsoft.quantum.contributing-qdk.overview.style).  The old callable names are deprecated.  Programs that use the old callables will continue to work with a compile-time warning.

#### New samples

We added a [sample of using Q# with F# driver](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/pull/164).  

**"Thank you!"** to the following contributor to our open code base at http://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum. These contributions add significantly to the rich samples of Q# code:

- Mathias Soeken ([@msoeken](https://github.com/msoeken)): Oracle function synthesis. [PR #135](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/pull/135).

#### Migrating existing projects to 0.6.1905.

See the [install guide](xref:microsoft.quantum.install-qdk.overview) to update the QDK.
  
If you have existing Q# projects from version 0.5 of the Quantum Development Kit, the following are the steps to migrate those projects to the newest version.

1. Projects need to be upgraded in order.  If you have a solution with multiple projects, update each project in the order they're referenced.
2. From a command prompt, Run `dotnet clean` to remove all existing binaries and intermediate files.
3. In a text editor, edit the `.csproj` file to change the version of all the `Microsoft.Quantum` `PackageReference` to version 0.6.1904, and change the `Microsoft.Quantum.Canon` package name to `Microsoft.Quantum.Standard`, for example:

    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Quantum.Standard" Version="0.6.1905.301" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Quantum.Development.Kit" Version="0.6.1905.301" />
    ```
4. From the command prompt, run this command: `dotnet msbuild`  
5. After running this, you might still need to manually address errors because of the changes listed above.  In many cases, these errors will also be reported by IntelliSense in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
    - Open the root folder of the project or the containing solution in Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio Code.
    - After opening a `.qs` file in the editor, you should see the output of the Q# language extension in the output window.
    - After the project has loaded successfully (indicated in the output window) open each file and manually to address all remaining issues.

> [!NOTE]
> * For the 0.6 release, the language server included with the Quantum Development Kit does not support multiple workspaces.
> * In order to work with a project in Visual Studio Code, open the root folder containing the project itself and all referenced projects.
> * In order to work with a solution in Visual Studio, all projects contained in the solution need to be in the same folder as the solution or in one of its subfolders.  
> * References between projects migrated to 0.6 and higher and projects using older package versions are **not** supported.

#### Update existing projects

This release is fully backwards compatible. Just update the nuget packages in your projects to version `0.2.1806.1503-preview` and do a **full rebuild** to make sure all intermediate files are regenerated.

From Visual Studio, follow the normal instructions on how to [update a package](/nuget/tools/package-manager-ui#updating-a-package).

To update project templates for the command line, run the following command:

```bash
dotnet new -i "Microsoft.Quantum.ProjectTemplates::0.2.1806.1503-preview"
```

After running this command, any new projects created using `dotnet new <project-type> -lang Q#` will automatically use this version of the Quantum Development Kit.

To update an existing project to use the newest version, run the following command from within the directory for each project:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.Quantum.Development.Kit -v "0.2.1806.1503-preview"
dotnet add package Microsoft.Quantum.Canon -v "0.2.1806.1503-preview"
```

If an existing project also uses XUnit integration for unit testing, then a similar command can be used to update that package as well:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.Quantum.Xunit -v "0.2.1806.1503-preview"
```

Depending on the version of XUnit that your test project uses, you may also need to update XUnit to 2.3.1:

```bash
dotnet add package xunit -v "2.3.1" 
```

After the update, make sure you remove all temporary files generated by the previous version by doing:

```bash
dotnet clean 
```

#### Known issues

No additional known issues to report.

This release brings support for development on more platforms, language interoperability, and performance enhancements. Specifically:

- Support for macOS- and Linux-based development. 
- .NET Core compatibility, including support for Visual Studio Code across platforms.
- A full Open Source license for the Quantum Development Kit Libraries.
- Improved simulator performance on projects requiring 20 or more qubits.
- Interoperability with the Python language (preview release available on Windows).

#### .NET editions

The .NET platform is available through two different editions, the .NET Framework that is provided with Windows, and the open-source .NET Core that is available on Windows, macOS and Linux.
With this release, most parts of the Quantum Development Kit are provided as libraries for .NET Standard, the set of classes common to both Framework and Core.
These libraries are then compatible with recent versions of either .NET Framework or .NET Core.

To help ensure that projects written using the Quantum Development Kit are as portable as possible, we recommend that library projects written using the Quantum Development Kit target .NET Standard. Console applications should target .NET Core.
Since previous releases of the Quantum Development Kit only supported .NET Framework, you may need to migrate your existing projects. See below for details on how to do this.

#### Project migration

Projects created using previous versions of Quantum Development Kit will still work, as long as you don't update the NuGet packages used in them. To migrate existing code to the new version, do the following steps:

1. Create a new .NET Core project using the right type of Q# project template (Application, Library or Test Project).
2. Copy existing `.qs` and `.cs`/`.fs` files from the old project to the new project (using Add > Existing Item). Don't copy the AssemblyInfo.cs file.
3. Build and run the new project.

Note that the operation RandomWalkPhaseEstimation from the namespace Microsoft.Quantum.Canon was moved into the namespace Microsoft.Research.Quantum.RandomWalkPhaseEstimation in the [Microsoft/Quantum-NC](https://github.com/microsoft/quantum-nc) repository.

#### Known issues

- The `--filter` option to `dotnet test` doesn't work correctly for tests written in Q#.
  As a result, individual unit tests cannot be run in Visual Studio Code; we recommend using `dotnet test` at the command prompt to re-run all tests.

### QDK version 0.1.1801.1707

This release fixes some issues reported by the community. Namely:

- The simulator now works with early non-AVX-enabled CPUs.
- Regional decimal settings won't cause the Q# parser to fail.
- `SignD` primitive operation now returns `Int` rather than `Double`.

### QDK version 0.1.1712.901

#### Known issues

##### Hardware and software requirements

- The simulator included with the Quantum Development Kit requires a 64-bit installation of Microsoft Windows to run.
- Microsoft's quantum simulator, installed with the Quantum Development Kit, uses Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX), and requires an AVX-enabled CPU. Intel processors shipped in Q1 2011 (Sandy Bridge) or later support AVX. We're evaluating support for earlier CPUs and may announce details at a later time.

##### Project creation

- When creating a solution (.sln) that will use Q#, the solution must be one directory higher than each project (`.csproj`) in the solution. When creating a new solution, this can be accomplished by making sure that the "Create directory for solution" checkbox on the "New Project" dialog box is checked. If this isn't done, the Quantum Development Kit NuGet packages will need to be installed manually.

##### Q#

- Intellisense doesn't display proper errors for Q# code. Make sure that you're displaying Build errors in the Visual Studio Error List to see correct Q# errors. Also note that Q# errors won't show up until after you've done a build.
- Using a mutable array in a partial application may lead to unexpected behavior.
- Binding an immutable array to a mutable array (let a = b, where b is a mutable array) may lead to unexpected behavior.
- Profiling, code coverage and other VS plugins may not always count Q# lines and blocks accurately.
- The Q# compiler doesn't validate interpolated strings. It's possible to create C# compilation errors by misspelling variable names or using expressions in Q# interpolated strings.

##### Simulation

- The Quantum Simulator uses OpenMP to parallelize the linear algebra required. By default OpenMP uses all available hardware threads, which means that programs with small numbers of qubits will often run slowly because the coordination required will dwarf the actual work. This can be fixed by setting the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to a small number. As a very rough rule of thumb, 1 thread is good for up to about 4 qubits, and then an additional thread per qubit is good, although this is highly dependent on your algorithm.

##### Debugging

- F11 (step in) doesn't work in Q# code.
- Code highlighting in Q# code at a breakpoint or single-step pause is sometimes inaccurate. The correct line will be highlighted, but sometimes the highlight will start and end at incorrect columns on the line.

##### Testing

- Tests must be run in 64-bit mode. If your tests are failing with a BadImageFormatException, go to the Test menu and select Test Settings > Default Processor Architecture > X64.
- Some tests take a long time (possibly as much as 5 minutes depending on your computer) to run. This is normal, as some use over twenty qubits; our largest test currently runs on 23 qubits.

##### Samples

- On some machines, some small samples may run slowly unless the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS is set to "1". See also the release note under "Simulation".

##### Libraries

- There's an implicit assumption that the qubits passed to an operation in different arguments are all distinct. For instance, all of the library operations (and all of the simulators) assume that the two qubits passed to a controlled NOT are different qubits. Violating this assumption may lead to unpredictable unexpected. It's possible to test for this using the quantum computer tracer simulator.
- The `Microsoft.Quantum.Bind` function may not act as expected in all cases.
- In the `Microsoft.Quantum.Extensions.Math` namespace, the `SignD` function returns a `Double` rather than an `Int`, although the underlying `System.Math.Sign` function always returns an `integer`. It's safe to compare the result against 1.0, -1.0, and 0.0, since these `doubles` all have exact binary representations.
