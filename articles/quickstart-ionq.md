# IonQ quickstart for Azure Quantum

Learn how to use Azure Quantum to run Q# problems against the IonQ simulator or QPU.

## Prerequisites

- To complete this tutorial you need an Azure subscription. If you don't have
  an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- In this guide we'll use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) which you can download and use for free.

## Install the Quantum Development Kit (QDK) and other resources

Before you can write a Q# program and run it with IonQ, you'll need a few resources installed:

1. Install the [Microsoft QDK for VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.quantum-devkit-vscode).
1. Install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
1. Install the `quantum` CLI extension for the Azure CLI.

   ```bash
   az extension add -n quantum
   ```

## Create an Azure Quantum workspace

You use the Azure Quantum service by adding an Azure Quantum workspace resource to your Azure subscription in the Azure portal. An Azure Quantum workspace resource, or workspace for short, is a collection of assets associated with running quantum or optimization applications.

To open the Azure Portal, go to https://portal.azure.com and then follow these steps:

> Note: This is a special link that allows you to create a workspace in the Azure Portal. Without using the link you will be able to see existing workspaces but not create new ones.

1. Click **Create a resource** and then search for **Azure Quantum**. On the results page, you should see a tile for the **Azure Quantum (preview)** service.

   ![Tile for the Azure Quantum (preview)
   service](./media/azure-quantum-preview-search.png)

1. Click **Azure Quantum (preview)** and then click  **Create**. This opens a form to create a workspace.

   ![Create resource for the Azure Quantum (preview)
   service](./media/azure-quantum-preview-create.png)

1. Fill out the details of your workspace:
   - **Subscription:** The subscription that you want to associate with this
     workspace. 
   - **Resource group:** The resource group that you want to assign this workspace to.
   - **Name:** The name of your workspace.
   - **Region:** The region for the workspace.
   - **Storage Account**: The Azure storage account to store your jobs and results. If you don't have an existing storage account, click **Create a new storage account** and complete the necessary fields. For this preview, we recommend using the default values.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You must be an Owner of the selected resource group to create a new storage account. For more information about how resource groups work in Azure, see [Control and organize Azure resources with Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/control-and-organize-with-azure-resource-manager/).

1. After completing the information, click the **Providers** tab to add providers to your workspace. A provider gives you access to a quantum service, which can be quantum hardware, a quantum simulator, or an optimization service.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you do not see the IonQ provider, you may not have access to their
   > preview yet. If you have received an email welcoming you to the IonQ Preview
   > but you can't see their provider, please [create a ticket with Azure Support](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request).

   ![Providers for Azure Quantum](./media/azure-quantum-preview-providers.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > By default, the Azure Quantum service adds the Microsoft QIO provider to every workspace.

1. Add at least the IonQ provider, then click **Review + create**.

1. Review the settings and approve the *Terms and Conditions of Use* of
   the selected providers. If everything is correct, click **Create** to create your workspace.

   ![Review and create the workspace](./media/azure-quantum-preview-terms.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Pricing for Azure Quantum varies by provider. Please consult the information in the Providers tab of your Azure Quantum workspace in the Azure portal for the most up-to-date pricing information.

## Setup your project and write your program

Next, we'll open up Visual Studio Code and get create a Q# Project.

1. In VS Code open the **View** menu and select **Command Palette**.

1. Type **Q#: Create New Project**.

1. Select **Standalone console application**.

1. Select a directory to hold your project, such as your home directory. Enter **QuantumRNG** as the project name, then select **Create Project**.

1. From the window that appears at the bottom, select **Open new project**.

1. You should see two files: the project file and **Program.qs**, which contains starter code. Open **Program.qs**.

1. Start by opening the **QuantumRNG.csproj** file and adding the `ExecutionTarget` property, which will give you design-time feedback on the compatibility of your program for IonQ's hardware.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.Quantum.Sdk/0.14.2011120240">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
    <ExecutionTarget>ionq.qpu</ExecutionTarget>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

1. Replace the contents of **Program.qs** with the program:

```qsharp
namespace QuantumRNG {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Measurement;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

    @EntryPoint()
    operation GenerateRandomBits() : Result[] {
        use qubits = Qubit[4];
        ApplyToEach(H, qubits);
        return MultiM(qubits);
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you would like to learn more about this program code, we recommend [Create your first Q# program by using the Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/qsharp-create-first-quantum-development-kit/).

## Prepare the AZ CLI

Next, we'll prepare your environment to run the program against the workspace you created.

1. Use `quantum workspace set` to select the workspace you created above
   as the default Workspace. Note that you also need to specify your subscription ID, which can be found in the overview of your workspace in Azure Portal, as well as the resource group and location you created it in, for example:

   ```dotnetcli
   az quantum workspace set --subscription MySubscriptionID --resource-group MyResourceGroup --workspace MyWorkspace --location westus --output table

   Location     Name                               ResourceGroup
   -----------  ---------------------------------  --------------------------------
   westus       ws-yyyyyy                          rg-yyyyyyyyy

   ```

1. In your workspace, there are different targets available from the
   providers that you added when you created the workspace. You can display a list of all
   the available targets with the command `az quantum target list -o table`:

   ```dotnetcli
   az quantum target list -o table

   Provider    Target-id                                       Status     Average Queue Time
   ----------  ----------------------------------------------  ---------  --------------------
   ionq        ionq.qpu                                        Available  0
   ionq        ionq.simulator                                  Available  0
   ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you submit a job in Azure Quantum it will wait in a queue until the
    > provider is ready to run your program. The **Average Queue Time** column of
    > the target list command shows you how long recently run jobs waited in the queue. This can give you an idea of how long you
    > might have to wait.

## Simulate the program

Before you run a program against real hardware, we recommend simulating it first (if possible, based on the number of qubits required) to help ensure that your algorithm is doing what you want. Fortunately, IonQ provides an idealized simulator that you can use.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also simulate Q# programs locally using the [Full State Simulator](xref:microsoft.quantum.machines.overview.full-state-simulator).

Run your program with `az quantum execute --target-id ionq.simulator -o table`. This command will compile your program, submit it to Azure Quantum, and wait until IonQ has finished simulating the program. Once it's done it will output a histogram which should look like the one below:

   ```dotnetcli
   az quantum execute --target-id ionq.simulator -o table

   .........
   Result     Frequency
   ---------  -----------  -------------------------
   [0,0,0,0]  0.06250000   ▐█                      |
   [1,0,0,0]  0.06250000   ▐█                      |
   [0,1,0,0]  0.06250000   ▐█                      |
   [1,1,0,0]  0.06250000   ▐█                      |
   [0,0,1,0]  0.06250000   ▐█                      |
   [1,0,1,0]  0.06250000   ▐█                      |
   [0,1,1,0]  0.06250000   ▐█                      |
   [1,1,1,0]  0.06250000   ▐█                      |
   [0,0,0,1]  0.06250000   ▐█                      |
   [1,0,0,1]  0.06250000   ▐█                      |
   [0,1,0,1]  0.06250000   ▐█                      |
   [1,1,0,1]  0.06250000   ▐█                      |
   [0,0,1,1]  0.06250000   ▐█                      |
   [1,0,1,1]  0.06250000   ▐█                      |
   [0,1,1,1]  0.06250000   ▐█                      |
   [1,1,1,1]  0.06250000   ▐█                      |
   ```

This shows an equal frequency for each of the 16 possible states for measuring 4 qubits, which is what we expect from an idealized simulator! This means we're ready to run it on the QPU.

## Run the program on hardware

To run the program on hardware, we'll use the asynchronous job submission command `az quantum job submit`. Like the `execute` command this will compile and submit your program, but it won't wait until the execution 
is complete. We recommend this pattern for running against hardware, because you may need to wait a while for your job to finish. To get an idea of how long you can run `az quantum target list -o table` as described above.

   ```dotnetcli
   az quantum job submit --target-id ionq.qpu -o table

   Name        Id                                    Status    Target    Submission time
   ----------  ------------------------------------  --------  --------  ---------------------------------
   QuantumRNG  5aa8ce7a-25d2-44db-bbc3-87e48a97249c  Waiting   ionq.qpu  2020-10-22T22:41:27.8855301+00:00
   ```

The table above shows that your job has been submitted and is waiting for its turn to run. To check on the status, use the `az quantum job show` command, being sure to replace the `job-id` parameter with the Id output by the previous command:

   ```dotnetcli
    az quantum job show -o table --job-id 5aa8ce7a-25d2-44db-bbc3-87e48a97249c 

   Name        Id                                    Status    Target    Submission time
   ----------  ------------------------------------  --------  --------  ---------------------------------
   QuantumRNG  5aa8ce7a-25d2-44db-bbc3-87e48a97249c  Waiting   ionq.qpu  2020-10-22T22:41:27.8855301+00:00 
   ```

Eventually, you will see the `Status` in the above table change to `Succeeded`. Once that's done you can get the results from the job by running `az quantum job output`:

   ```dotnetcli
   az quantum job output -o table --job-id 5aa8ce7a-25d2-44db-bbc3-87e48a97249c 

   Result     Frequency
   ---------  -----------  -------------------------
   [0,0,0,0]  0.05200000   ▐█                      |
   [1,0,0,0]  0.07200000   ▐█                      |
   [0,1,0,0]  0.05000000   ▐█                      |
   [1,1,0,0]  0.06800000   ▐█                      |
   [0,0,1,0]  0.04600000   ▐█                      |
   [1,0,1,0]  0.06000000   ▐█                      |
   [0,1,1,0]  0.06400000   ▐█                      |
   [1,1,1,0]  0.07600000   ▐██                     |
   [0,0,0,1]  0.04800000   ▐█                      |
   [1,0,0,1]  0.06200000   ▐█                      |
   [0,1,0,1]  0.07400000   ▐█                      |
   [1,1,0,1]  0.08000000   ▐██                     |
   [0,0,1,1]  0.05800000   ▐█                      |
   [1,0,1,1]  0.06800000   ▐█                      |
   [0,1,1,1]  0.05200000   ▐█                      |
   [1,1,1,1]  0.07000000   ▐█                      |
   ```

The histogram you receive may be slightly different than the one above, but you should find that the states generally are observed with equal frequency.
