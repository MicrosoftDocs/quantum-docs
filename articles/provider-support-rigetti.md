# Support policy for Rigetti in Azure Quantum

This article describes the Microsoft support policy that applies when you use the Rigetti provider in Azure Quantum. The article applies to any of the [targets](xref:microsoft.quantum.providers.rigetti#targets) offered by the Rigetti provider.

## Support points of contact

### Azure support

In general, problems using the Rigetti provider on Microsoft Azure Quantum are best addressed with the Azure Quantum support team directly by [creating an Azure support case](/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request). This team has all the necessary details to isolate the issue you're experiencing and direct the report to the right point of contact. The Azure support team also has the means to reach Rigetti support outside of business hours for the most urgent issues.

### Rigetti support

In some situations, the Azure Support team will need to redirect you to Rigetti's support team. You may receive a quicker response by reaching out to Rigetti directly at [https://rigetti.zendesk.com/hc/](https://rigetti.zendesk.com/hc/). 

## Support timeline

Rigetti will always attempt to resolve issues with the Microsoft Azure integration as quickly as practical. Some issues will take longer to address than others, but the tables below indicate the time you may expect for an initial response from Rigetti after an issue report.

| Severity   | Definition        | Response SLA        |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| High | Failure in connectivity; complete performance degradation | 1 business day |
| Medium | Performance degradation | 2 business days |
| Low | Application-related concerns and questions | 5 business days |

*Business days* are defined as Monday through Friday, not counting US holidays. For example, if a medium-severity incident is reported on a Tuesday, a response will be returned by the end of the business day on Thursday, if the intervening days are also business days.
