# Share access to your Azure Quantum workspace

Learn how to share access to your [Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace). For example, you may need to grant your team members or students access to your workspace. 

We recommend using the instructions in this article if you need to grant access to 10 or less users. For a larger number of users, it may be easier for you or your IT department to create a group of users and then grant it access to your workspace. For instructions, see [Add a group to your Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.bulk-add-users).

## Prerequisites

You need the following prerequisites to share access to your Azure Quantum workspace:

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you donâ€™t have an Azure account, register for free and sign up for a [pay-as-you-go subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go).
- An Azure Quantum workspace. See [Create an Azure Quantum workspace](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.workspace).

## Azure Active Directory

Each user must have an account in your organization's Azure Active Directory before you can grant them access to your workspace. To add new users, you must be at least a **User Administrator**. For instructions, see [Add a new user](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory#add-a-new-user).

## Add users as contributors to your Azure Quantum workspace

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to your Azure Quantum workspace. You must be an **Owner** of the workspace in order to add users.

1. Select **Access control (IAM)** from the left-side menu. Select **Add**, and then **Add role assignment**.

## Share access using a connection string 

You can share the access to your Azure Quantum workspace using a [connection string](xref:microsoft.quantum.how-to.connect-workspace#connect-with-connection-string). The connection string contains the information needed to connect to your workspace, including the subscription ID, resource group, workspace name, and location.

Every Azure Quantum workspace has **primary and secondary** keys, and their corresponding connection strings. If you want to allow access to your workspace to others, you can share your secondary key and you use your primary for your own services. This way, you can replace the secondary key as needed without having downtime in your own services.
