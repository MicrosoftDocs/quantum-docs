# Pricing plans for Azure Quantum providers

In Azure Quantum, hardware and software providers define and control the pricing of their offerings. The information below is subject to change by providers and some delays in reflecting latest pricing information may exist. Be sure to verify the latest pricing information from the Azure Quantum workspace you are using. 

[!INCLUDE [Azure Quantum credits banner](includes/azure-quantum-credits.md)]
 
## IonQ 

[IonQ](https://ionq.com/) charges based on the number of gates in your program, the complexity of the gates you use, and the number of shots. These units are called *gate-shots*.

Every quantum program consists of $N$ quantum logical gates of one or more qubits, and is executed for a certain number of shots. The number of gate-shots is calculated by the following formula:

$$
QGS = N · C
$$

where:

- $N$ is the number of one- or two-qubit gates submitted
- $C$ is the number of execution shots requested

Multi-controlled two-qubit gates are billed as $6 * (N - 2)$ two-qubit gates, where $N$ is the number of qubits involved in the gate. For example, a NOT gate with three controls would be billed as $(6 * (4 - 2))$ or 12 two-qubit gates. One-qubit gates are billed as 0.225 of a two-qubit gate (rounded down). To learn more about IonQ, visit [IonQ provider page](xref:microsoft.quantum.providers.ionq).

All new Azure Quantum customers benefit of a one-time USD500 free Azure Quantum credits toward IonQ provider to use in IonQ QPUs Harmony and Aria, and quantum simulator. Besides the Azure Quantum Credits plan, IonQ offers a **pay-as-you-go** plan with access to the quantum simulator and the IonQ Harmony 11-qubit quantum computer, and a **monthly subscription** plan which expands the access to the IonQ Aria 1 25-qubit quantum computer. 

### [Azure Quantum Credits](#tab/tabid-AQcredits)

Azure Quantum Credits consumption is based on a resource-usage model and cost of use is deducted from your credit balance. To learn more about credits, see [Azure Quantum Credits](xref:microsoft.quantum.credits).

## Quantinuum

[Quantinuum](https://www.quantinuum.com/) uses a credit system that charges each job depending on the number of operations in the job, and the number of shots you run. The usage units are *H-System Quantum Credits (HQCs)* for jobs submitted to quantum computers and emulator HQCs (eHQCs) for jobs submitted to emulators.

> [!NOTE]
> Do not confuse the Quantinuum HQCs with the Azure Quantum credits. Quantinuum HQCs are a usage unit defined by the provider to track the usage and quotas of their targets.

HQCs and eHQCs are used to calculate the cost of running a job, and they are calculated based on the following formula:

$$
HQC = 5 + C(N_{1q} + 10 N_{2q} + 5 N_m)/5000
$$

where:

- $N_{1q}$ is the number of single-qubit operations in a circuit.
- $N_{2q}$ is the number of native two-qubit operations in a circuit. Native gate is equivalent to CNOT up to several single-qubit gates.
- $N_{m}$ is the number of state preparation and measurement (SPAM) operations in a circuit including initial implicit state preparation and any intermediate and final measurements and state resets.
- $C$ is the shot count.

To learn more about Quantinuum, visit the [Quantinuum provider page](xref:microsoft.quantum.providers.quantinuum).

All new Azure customers benefit from USD500 in free credits towards the Quantinuum provider. Besides Azure Quantum credits, Quantinuum provides four plans: **Standard**, **Premium**, **Standard H1 + H2**, and **Premium H1 + H2**.

### [Azure Quantum Credits](#tab/tabid-AQcreditsQ)
