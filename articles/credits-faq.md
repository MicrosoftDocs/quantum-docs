We try to respond to all applications for credits within one (1) month of the application date.

## I received my approval notice. What happens next?

Your approval notice will contain a link to an onboarding survey, which you will need to fill out completely. Once you have completed the survey, your credits will be made available within two (2) weeks or on the start date of your credits grant, whichever is later.

When your credits are available to be used, you will receive detailed instructions on to do so.

### My credits are available to use. What is the onboarding process?

Instructions for configuring your Azure Quantum workspace to access Azure Quantum Credits program:

1. Create a new [**Azure Quantum workspace**](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.AzureQuantum) in the Azure portal.
2. On the **Basics** tab while configuring your workspace, ensure the selected **Subscription** matches the subscription you supplied in your onboarding information. The subscription information is also copied in the onboarding mail you received.
3. On the **Basics** tab while configuring your workspace, ensure the selected **Region** matches the subscription you supplied in your onboarding information. The region information is also copied in the onboarding mail you received.
4. On the **Providers** tab, select the provider for which you have been granted credits. When the plan/pricing selector opens, ensure you select **Azure Quantum Credits**. If you have received grants towards more than one provider, you may add all of them to the same Azure Quantum workspace or you may create multiple workspaces.

> [!TIP]
> Not sure how to find the subscription with the ID specified in the email? View the [list of your Azure subscriptions](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) to identify which should be selected.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> If you select any plan other than **Azure Quantum Credits**, you may be charged for usage. If you do not see the Azure Quantum Credits plan, please double check that you have selected the correct **Subscription** and **Region**, then send an email to the support email address specified in your credits onboarding emailÂ if you cannot see the plan.


## My application was rejected. Can I appeal the decision or reapply?

Rejections may be made for a number of reasons, including the contents of the application or other business reasons, and may not be appealed. In the event of substantial changes to your proposed project, or the group carrying out the project, you may reapply.

In some cases, your rejection notice may specify that insufficient information was provided to evaluate the application, or note that resources that were linked to in the application were not accessible to reviewers. In this case, you may reapply to the program while providing more information.

## I couldn't find an answer to my question, how can I get support?

If you have an Azure support subscription, we recommend connecting with [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/#get-support) for the fastest resolution to your question.
