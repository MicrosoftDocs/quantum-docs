# Support Policy for Honeywell in Azure Quantum

This article describes the Microsoft support policy that applies when you use the Honeywell provider in Azure Quantum. The article applies to any of the targets under this provider.

If you are using the Honeywell provider and hit any unexpected issues that you cannot troubleshoot yourself, you can usually contact the Azure Support team for help by [creating an Azure support case](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request).

There are however some situations, where the Azure Support team will need to redirect you to Honeywell's support team, or where you may receive a quicker response by reaching out to Honeywell directly. This article aims to provide more detail on this based on some frequently asked questions.

## Honeywell Support Policy - Public Preview
The goal of Support is to identify and remedy defects or malfunctions causing the Quantum Computer to fail to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications and documentation (“Problems”). Support only covers the current released version generally available to customers.  Although our quantum experts can help you troubleshoot algorithm issues, we are not responsible for any issues, problems, or defects with your algorithm. To minimize programming issues, users are able to run their algorithms through the syntax validator prior to running on hardware.  

### 1.1	CONTACTING TECHNICAL SUPPORT WITHIN HONEYWELL QUANTUM SOLUTIONS

To create a support request with Honeywell Quantum Solutions, submit an incident report via email to HoneywellAzureQuantumSupport@Honeywell.com. The on-call engineer will respond within the appropriate SLA (Table 2). Note that only incident reports that contain all of the below information will notify the Honeywell Quantum Solutions team and have the appropriate SLA resolution window. Reports without the necessary information will not trigger this response. All requests must be provided in the English language and will be answered in the English language.

_Table 1: Support Contact information and Standard Operating Hours_
| Email | Standard Operating Hours |
| - | - |
| <a href="mailto:HoneywellAzureQuantumSupport@Honeywell.com">HoneywellAzureQuantumSupport@Honeywell.com</a> | 8am – 5pm MST on Business Days<sup>1</sup> |

_<sup>1</sup> “Business Days” means Monday to Friday but excluding national, legal, or bank holidays._

The incident report will require the following information:

- Description: A detailed description of the issue you are facing, what you are observing, and any steps you have already taken to triage/understand the issue
- Primary contact: A primary contact name and phone number in case we require more information
- Incident Severity: the severity of the incident, according to our severity definitions

Once a report is filed, the Honeywell Quantum Solutions team will be notified and will respond within the required SLA window. You will receive an acknowledgement of the issue once it has been received and the on-call engineer has been notified. The on-call engineer may request more information, or may call you at the contact number listed in the report depending on the severity. 

During Reserved (dedicated) Sessions, Honeywell Quantum Solutions will provide at least one quantum specialist available to you for customer support for the entirety of your dedicated session. Honeywell reserves the right to change out the specialist during your session, but will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the new specialist is prepared to continue providing support.     

During Queued Runs, if your job is running in the general queue and you encounter an issue, you may submit your issue request online at: <a href="mailto:HoneywellAzureQuantumSupport@Honeywell.com">HoneywellAzureQuantumSupport@Honeywell.com</a>. You can expect to receive an answer within three (3) business days.  

### 1.2	HONEYWELL QUANTUM SOLUTIONS SEVERITY INDEX AND RESPONSE SLA

If the Honeywell Quantum Solutions engineer determines that the issue does not fall within the bounds of our incident response commitments, or does not have the right severity classification, they may opt at their sole discretion to adjust the severity and/or end support if the new severity does not require it.

Certain problems may be easier to address than others, and we may not be able to completely resolve the problem with our initial response. If we are unable to reasonably resolve the problem, we will make a good faith effort to give an assessment of the issue and an estimated time for resolution. 

_Table 2: Definition of Severity Index_

| Severity	| Meaning | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Severity 1| 	Significant Impact | System performance degraded below minimum accepted level |
| Severity 2| 	Urgent or high impact | Job status has not updated; issues retrieving data |
| Severity 3| 	Not urgent | Miscellaneous  |

The table below shows the Response SLA that will be adhered to by Honeywell Quantum Solutions for incident reports of the corresponding severity. Note that these define how fast we will respond to issues – resolution times are not guaranteed.

_Table 3: Response SLA for Various Severity_
| Severity	| Response SLA |
| - | - |
| Severity 1	| Business hours response within 1 hour |
| Severity 2	| Business hours response within 1 business day |
| Severity 3	| Business hours response within 3 business days |
